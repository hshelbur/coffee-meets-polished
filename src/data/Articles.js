<p>Before you read on, I want to emphasize that your health is your choice based on informed and shared decision-making between you and your healthcare team. I am a healthcare professional and practice as a pharmacist licensed in two states. This post is an avenue to introduce you to information and urge you to remain aware and engaged of your personal health.</p>
<p><b>Now, let’s talk about breasts!</b></p>
<p><iframe title="USA TODAY - Embed Player" width="540" height="304" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="//www.usatoday.com/videos/embed/106118284/?fullsite=true"></iframe></p>
<p>1. <b>General facts.</b></p>
<p className="tabbed">• Cancer occurs when cells grow out of control. Breast cancer is one example where these cells originate in the breast. It can start from different parts of the breast, but most begin in the ducts that carry milk in to the nipple. Some will also start in the glands that make breast milk.<br></br>
• Breast cancer is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most common type of cancer among women</a> of all races and Hispanic origin populations.<br></br>
• Breast cancer is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic women</a>; and second among white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.<br></br>
• A clinical breast exam performed by a health professional is <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-american-cancer-society-new-breast-cancer-screening-guideline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer recommended by the American Cancer Society</a>. Mammographies have improved over time and combined with women’s awareness with self breast exams, the few studies that exist suggest the clinical breast exam contributes very little to detection. Keep up the awareness, everyone!<br></br>
• Insurance coverage is usually linked to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening recommendations. Check your insurance provider to determine at what age your mammograms are covered.</p>
<p>2. <b>Know thy breasts.</b></p>
<p>Performing a breast self-exam is encouraged monthly. It is important to do so in order to be able to detect changes in your breasts and consult your healthcare professional. The self-exam should be performed in the shower, in front of a mirror, or lying down. You can find instructions on how to perform a breast self-exam <a href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-self-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>3. <b>Screening recommendations.</b></p>
<p>The American Cancer Society recommend the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/cancer-screening-guidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following screening guidelines for most adults:</a></p>
<p className="tabbed">• <b>Women ages 40 to 44</b> should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x-rays of the breast) if they wish to do so.<br></br>
• <b>Women ages 45 to 54</b> should get mammograms every year.<br></br>
• <b>Women ages 55 and older</b> should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening.<br></br>
• <b>ALL women</b> should be familiar with the known benefits, limitations, and potential harms linked to breast cancer screening.<br></br>
• Screening should continue as long as a women is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer.<br></br></p>
<p>It is important to understand that organizations may have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/pdf/BreastCancerScreeningGuidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different recommendations</a>. I encourage you to understand what your healthcare professional follows as well as your health benefits coverage.</p>
<p>4. <b>What exams are done for screening?</b></p>
<p className="tabbed">• <b>Mammogram.</b> X-ray picture of the breast. It is read by a radiologist to assess for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. Some tips include not wearing deodorant, perfume, or powder on the day of your mammogram as these products may show up as white spots on the X-ray. Also, some women prefer to wear a top with a skirt or pants instead of a dress because you will need to undress from your waste up for the mammogram.<br></br>
• <b>Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</b> A test that uses magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the breast. Some women may be screened with MRI’s along with mammograms because of family history, genetic tendency, or other certain factors.<br></br></p>
<p>5. <b>What are the warning signs of breast cancer?</b></p>
<p>CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/pdf/BreastCancerFactSheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning signs</a> of breast cancer include:</p>
<p className="tabbed">• New lump in the breast or underarm (armpit)<br></br>
• Thickening or swelling of part of the breast<br></br>
• Irritation or dimpling of breast skin<br></br>
• Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast<br></br>
• Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area<br></br>
• Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood<br></br>
• Any change in the size or the shape of the breast<br></br>
• Pain in the breast<br></br></p>
<p>6. <b>How can I afford to get screened?</b></p>
<p>You can get screened for breast cancer at a clinic, hospital, or doctor’s office. Most health insurance plans are required to cover mammograms beginning at age 40 with no out-of-pocket cost. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also offers free or low-cost mammograms if you meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood health centers also provides breast exams and mammogram referrals. Search for a health center near you <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a> or call 1-800-230-PLAN for care today.</p>
<p>7. <b>Where can I donate?</b></p>
<p>It’s important to know the organization you donate to and what they do with your generous donations. One site to use when scouting where to donate is <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charity Watch</a>. Highly rated organizations according to Charity Watch include <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/breast-cancer-research-foundation/117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breast Cancer Research Foundation</a> (A+ rating), <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/national-breast-cancer-coalition-fund/139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund</a> (A rating), and <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/breast-cancer-prevention-partners/114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breast Cancer Prevention Partners</a> [formerly Breast Cancer Fund] (A- rating). These focus specifically on breast cancer prevention and research.</p>
<p>Charity Navigator is another system that uses star ratings to evaluate how efficiently a charity uses your donations. The highest rating is four stars. Four star-rated organizations from this system include <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Breast Cancer Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=11077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynn Sage Cancer Research Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I chose to donate by also supporting a YouTube Beauty Influencer whose grandmother died of breast cancer. KathleenLights launched her own nail polish line, <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KL Polish</a> last year and this month she released a limited edition nail polish, <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/products/mami-martha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mami Martha</a> where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT27F1zfItM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100% of profits</a> go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. I’ve been wearing this color to show my support for research of treatments to fight cancer.</p>

<img src="/images/ethnicity.jpg" alt="Ethnicity" />
<p>I currently live in the most diverse city in the world, New York City, where there are <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/population-facts.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 200 languages spoken among the five boroughs</a>. Growing up in Central Florida, I never thought I was different from anyone else. Yet, a lot of times I get asked certain questions to confirm that I am Filipina-American. I almost come to expect it when I see someone do a double take in the corner of my eye or stare at me as if they’re trying to figure it out. My complexion and facial features can be confused as any type of Pacific Islander, certain Asian countries (depending on where I am), and hispanic.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked in many ways that demonstrate to me a person’s cultural understanding of appropriateness. When I lived in North Carolina, I got a lot of questions because I was the minority. I’d been considered “exotic” from some, and even been “hola’d” by older Caucasian men. And some simply made me think “bless your heart,” with their inquiries. Here’s a sampling of a few examples:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>What are you?</b> My gut reaction is to say, “Human, just like you.” But generally I will pause and ask for clarification.<br></br>
2. <b>Where are you from?</b> Again, my gut reaction is to say, “The United States of America.” But instead, I say “Florida,” even if I know what he/she is really trying to get at.<br></br>
3. <b>But where are you FROM, from?</b> This is the common follow-up question when I answer the previous question.<br></br> 
4. <b>But like… where are your ancestors from?</b> This is one I got while I lived in North Carolina.<br></br></p>
<p>When I was younger, I would answer “I’m Filipina,” to these questions because I knew what the intent of the questions were. Now, I take the opportunity to teach others by clarifying with the appropriate way to ask the question. Generally speaking, if you are inquiring to know what country other than the United States of America that a person identifies with, you are asking for their <b>ethnicity</b>. If you want to know where they have their citizenship, ask about <b>nationality</b>. </p>
<p>Here are some basic definitions to help navigate the conversation:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Race.</b> Refers to the appearance of a person, including the color of his/her skin<br></br>
2. <b>Nationality.</b> Refers to the place where a person was born and/or holds citizenship<br></br>
3. <b>Ethnicity.</b> Based on a group that is generally based on similar traits such as a common language, common heritage, and cultural similarities within the group<br></br>
4. <b>Culture.</b> Set of values, conventions, or social practices associated with a particular racial, religious, or social group<br></br></p>
<p>It’s a wonderful thing when the diversity of a population is embraced. We learn from each other and recognize strengths in others where we have weakness and capitalize on teamwork for the greater good. When you ask about someone’s ethnicity, follow up with questions about their culture and take the opportunity to broaden your horizons and understand their perspectives. Start a conversation, don’t just say, “I knew it!” and move along. We can all benefit from learning more about each other.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it is about wearing a red lipstick making me feel more confident. It wasn’t always easy for me to wear it, and honestly I still think a few times before I actually commit to putting it on. But once I do, I never regret it. Whenever someone is wearing a red lipstick, your eyes immediately are drawn to it. And with the right tone and shade, your teeth even look whiter. I’ve tried a lot of different brands and formulas at this point and have some preferred characteristics. The bottom line is you figure out what tone and formula works best for you, take a deep breath, and rock the red.</p>
<p>Here is my collection of red lip products for medium skin. For skin color reference, my foundations are Maybelline Fit Me Matte & Poreless in Natural Tan (320) and Revlon Colorstay in Toast (370).</p>
<img src="/images/nyxcombo.jpeg" alt="Nyx Combo" />
<p><b><a href="http://www.ulta.com/lipstick-retro-matte?productId=xlsImpprod15921178#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nyx Slim Lip Pencil in Hot Red</a>.</b> For liner, I like the Nyx brand. It’s affordable and because I don’t wear red lipstick every day, I value that in a liner. It’s also creamy but long-wearing. I usually line my lips when I’m using a liquid lipstick because I’m not great yet at applying those (practice makes perfect).</p>
<img src="/images/esteecombo.jpg" alt="Estee Combo" />
<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JG7Y6NU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00JG7Y6NU&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=117cbb893d5f13d56754d616b09bc1a3">Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick, Red Ego</a>.</b> Estee Lauder is a high-end department store brand that I started exploring first because my mom took me to the counter to get color-matched. This was before I knew how to navigate my way through Sephora and Ulta, and didn’t feel confident in myself to even get a bold color. So I took a risk with this one, my first real lipstick. This was the lipstick that I bought after ending the previously mentioned relationship and decided that I was going to start making my own decisions of what I should and shouldn’t put on my face. This red is bold and deep, and the formulation is creamy and very comfortable.</p>
<img src="/images/maccombo.jpeg" alt="Mac Combo" />
<p><b><a href="http://www.ulta.com/lipstick-retro-matte?productId=xlsImpprod15921178#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac Ruby Woo</a>.</b> After getting the Estee Lauder Red Ego, I was hooked on red. In my beauty literacy-building days (let’s face it, i’m still in that phase), I read how this was THE red to have. Its blue tones made your teeth white and it lasted all day. So This was the second one I ever purchased. It definitely tugs and pulls on your lips and requires a touch of patience to put on. But once it’s on, it’s not going anywhere. Tip: Exfoliate and hydrate your lips before putting this one on as it is pretty drying.</p>
<img src="/images/ofracombo.jpeg" alt="Ofra Combo" />
<p><b><a href="http://www.ulta.com/long-lasting-liquid-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod15931207&sku=2511377&_requestid=1688165#
" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ofra Venice</a>.</b>Ofra makes one of my favorite liquid lipstick formulations. It’s mousse-like texture dries down extremely comfortably (Warning: not transfer-proof). This shade is more on the orange side, which is perfect for spring and summer seasons.</p>
<img src="/images/sephoracombo.jpeg" alt="Sephora Combo" />
<p><b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-lip-stain-liquid-lipstick-P281411?skuId=1296060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sephora Creamy Matte Lipstick in Always Red</a>.</b> I tried out this formulation in another color and it’s AMAZING. I want all of the colors someday. But I also heard amazing things about the shade of red in this line. It’s perfect. I would consider it to be the same red as Ruby Woo, but in a liquid lipstick and TRANSFER-PROOF formulation. If I had to pick one red to keep from my whole collection, it would be this one.</p>
<img src="/images/narscombo.jpeg" alt="Nars Combo" />
<p><b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-lip-stain-liquid-lipstick-P281411?skuId=1296060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nars Velvet Lip Glide in Le Palace</a>.</b> If you love the Audacious Lipstick line (who doesn’t, really?) then you’ll love their liquid lipstick line. It’s the Audacious Lipstick liquified and poured into a bottle. This shade is a beautiful, comfortable, and creamy formulation that leaves a shiny finish and isn’t drying. Side note, this transfers.</p>
<p>I hope these give you some ideas of red lips that you can rock for medium skin. Don’t be afraid to go bold and wear these colors any time of year. I pair these reds with a basic black eyeliner and loaded up mascara and walk out the door. Be confident in red - trust me, you’ll look great.</p>

<img src="/images/literacyvol1.jpg" alt="Literacy Roundup Vol. 1" />
<p>Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images</p>
<p>It’s been a big week in political events of this country and things I’ve been reading/listening to improve my cultural literacy. These are what I’ve been learning about through podcasts, articles, news, etc. this past week along with some of my brief thoughts around the topics.</p>
<p>1. <b><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556606150/trump-rescinds-obamacare-birth-control-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump rescinds birth control mandate</a>.</b> This week, Trump made it easier for employers to opt out of covering birth control in their health insurance plans for religious reasons, which was previously guaranteed under the Obama presidential era. The claim by Trump is that the administration is leading by example on religious liberty. I couldn’t disagree more. I mentioned in my previous post <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introducing topics to improve your feminism literacy</a> that family planning is incredibly important. Women have the most to lose with this rollback. By instilling barriers for women to make decisions on what happens to their bodies in a society without infrastructure to support partum and post-partum maternity care is wrong. Why should our boss make the decision as to whether we can afford family planning? This isn't just going backwards in time but it further develops the divide in opportunity between the rich and poor. Finally, there are <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/7-awesome-benefits-of-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other medical uses</a> of birth control that can improve women’s comfort from periods, hormonal imbalances leading to severe psychological symptoms, and save women’s lives.</p>
<p>2. <b><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556116385/nature-nurture-and-our-evolving-debates-about-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR Hidden Brain: Edge of Gender</a>.</b> I lived in North Carolina when the infamous HB2 (“<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/the-bathroom-bill-that-ate-north-carolina-214944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bathroom Bill</a>”) was passed requiring transgender citizens to use the bathroom that coincides with the sex identified on his/her birth certificate. That was one of the first times I realized there was so much hate towards things that challenge diversity in the South. Don’t get me wrong, I definitely understand the history of hate, but this was the first time I realized how prevalent it still is. This along with other experiences I’ve had sent me on this constant quest to challenge societal gender norms. This podcast was a refreshing, science-based discussion on the nature vs. nurture debate about the gender spectrum. If you listen to podcasts, I highly recommend you listen to this. It took me a few train rides to get through it because it is a bit lengthy, but totally worth it. The biggest takeaways were acknowledging that while there are innate instincts that exist purely from biology and evolution of men and women (nature), a lot of our gender identities are from society (nurture). Things like our upbringing, business marketing, tradition and laws have an affect on how we act and believe we should act based on our outward-appearing gender.</p>
<p>3. <b>Sexual Assault.</b> This is a big one, and there are so many recent events related to it. To name a couple: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/09/07/549250118/betsy-devos-signals-roll-back-of-obama-policies-on-campus-sexual-assault" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Title IX rollback</a>. I have so many thoughts about these but I’ll braindump a few just to get them out there. 1) It’s scary how easy it is for women to be manipulated by men in power because of fear and lack of physical contact. 2) Mental/emotional harassment can have a long-lasting effect on women. We must be able to recognize when it is happening to us and not back down to fight it.</p>
<p>4. <b><a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-deuce/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Deuce</a>.</b> My boyfriend and I have been watching one of the new HBO shows, The Deuce, where <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2017/10/02/maggie-gyllenhaal-changes-her-mind-on-sex-work-after-portraying-a-prostitute-in-the-deuce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as “Candy”, a prostitute and single mother</a>. The show chronicles the rise of pornography and is set in 1970’s New York City - mostly Times Square. Needless to say, 42nd Street was different then than it is now. I find myself challenging a lot of what I thought about sex work after each episode. My instincts are to judge negatively, feel sorry for, and want to save these women. However, what I’m learning is that a woman’s sexuality is incredibly complex. My brain goes in circles when I consider how things like prostitution and pornography can entrap women so strongly yet also be liberating and empowering. Highly recommend you check it out; it’s not for the faint of heart, but speaks such an important message.</p>
<p>5. <b><a href="http://girlsautoclinic.com/shecanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#sheCANics</a>.</b> I just started subscribing to the podcast called Stuff Mom Never Told You and it’s AWESOME. All of them leave me so much more informed about important topics but also get my mind flowing to challenge how things are versus how they could be in the world. One of my favorite ones so far was about <a href="http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/podcasts/women-trades.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women and the Trades</a> starring Patrice Banks, founder of Girls Auto Clinic. It’s an auto shop that provides a safe space for women to get their car maintenance and repair without getting bamboozled by male mechanics that feel women don’t know any better. Unfortunately, I have definitely felt the need to bring a male friend with me to get my car fixed so I don’t get taken advantage of. I always just did it and never considered ways to fix that. But Patrice has created a movement that empowers women to learn more about auto repair, which almost makes me wish I still had a car so I could go to the shop. You can get your nails and hair done while you wait. So genius.</p>
<p>That’s a wrap for this roundup topics that stuck with me this week and my thoughts on them. Every day I feel more and more empowered to improve my literacy on topics so I can speak mindfully and intelligently to those with opposing views. I never want to say (as I have in the past), “I’m not well-versed enough to have an opinion yet” because then I lose my chance to speak my peace and attempt to provide well-rounded perspective to others. I hope these provide you with some resources to help you form your own well-informed opinions and feel empowered to seek change.</p>

<p>I’m starting to get into a work groove especially now that I’m past official orientation period, learned enough to have some independence, and beginning to do what’s in my job description. Along with the routine comes the essential component of making time for microadventures. Here’s a taste of some since <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volume 1.</a></p>
<img src="/images/medievalfestival.jpg" alt="Medieval Festival Ft Tyron" />
<p><a href="http://www.whidc.org/festival/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medieval Festival at Fort Tyron Park</a>. This is a festival that looks like it’s been happening for many years according to their website. It was full of people in costume, jousting, booths with medieval weapons and board games, and even archery! The only regret was not bringing any cash to to have some mead. Oh, and it’s free to enter!</p>
<img src="/images/thailunch.jpg" alt="Tung Thong Thai" />
<p><a href="https://www.seamless.com/menu/tung-thong-thai-restaurant-561-w-169th-st-new-york/283923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tung Thong Thai</a> lunch special. This is a small, hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant by my workplace that has become basically weekly tradition to have lunch. Pad thai chicken, soup, and choice of salad or egg roll all for $7.95. You better believe this was stretched to two meals making this quite the bargain. Oh, and it’s delicious (duh).</p>
<img src="/images/klpolish.jpg" alt="KL Polish Penny Wishbone" />
<p>I got some new nail polish from the <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KL Polish</a> brand in <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/products/princess-penny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Penny</a>, <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/products/wishbone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishbone</a>, and <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/products/mami-martha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mami Martha</a>. I’ll be doing a separate post on Mami Martha but I’m loving the copper/gold in Princess Penny along with the cool-toned nude in Wishbone. They’re unique colors I didn’t previously have in my collection.</p>

<p>I’ve finally added the toner step to my skin care routine after much deliberation and research as to its use. I decided on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0156XE3RQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0156XE3RQ&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=09476278d1470681223421c105e9d62d">Pixi Glow Tonic</a> because of its glycolic acid to add chemical exfoliation to my routine (and great reviews). I also dabbled into some smaller size Drunk Elephant products to see if it’s worth the splurge. I haven’t found the moisturizer to be anything special, but adding the toner step has given me noticeable softness and smoothness to my face. Will be keeping toner in my regimen permanently.</p>

<p>Since moving to New York City, I’ve been collecting shelves that I see tossed for trash along my walk home from work. I finally got to the point where I felt comfortable with what I collected and it was time to mount. My boyfriend was a trooper trying to get nails through some tough early 1900’s building walls and I’m in love. Here’s just one of the wall shelves that helped make some working counter space for making coffee and smoothies.</p>

<p>This World Mental Health Day, I’m sharing huge lessons I learned during one of the toughest phases of my life that inspired me to make this blog in the first place: <b>pharmacy residency</b>.</p>
<p>When I started residency there was one thing I knew: I was going to learn a helluva lot about my specialty. What I did NOT realize, and what you can’t know until you’ve gone through it, is how far your mental health gets tested, how far you fall, and how strong you can come out of it with the right support, humility, and will. I will not claim that residency is the hardest thing a person can go through. However, difficulty is relative and individual; what matters is what we learn from it. I also want to emphasize that my support structure of mentors, friends, and family helped to build me back up when I couldn’t see how anything could get better. Lean on your resources, lean on yourself, and lean into the struggle. You’ll be surprised and impressed with what you can handle.</p>
<p>1. <b>Saying no.</b> Starting out, you really want to impress because you’re basically on a constant interview and never want to disappoint. This translates you into any request for your assistance with tasks and projects results in a yes. And it becomes a vicious cycle of doing the extra work you said yes to instead of the minimum requirements and leaves you less essential mental recovery time. Over time I learned that if you know what your values and goals are, it makes prioritizing your activities easier. The first time I said no was over 6 months into the first year. It wasn’t actually a verbal “no” to someone, it was a not volunteering for something I knew I was skillfully capable of. While there are of course many requirements to complete residency, you have choices on what you do in your limited spare time. Be strategic for yourself instead of being a yes-person for everyone else.</p>
<p>2. <b>Seeking and accepting help.</b> This is something so many of us have difficulty with. Personally, I don’t want to burden others with my problems, but there came points in residency when I had no choice. I learned a few things:</p>
<p className="tabbed">a. If someone offers to help, assume it’s because they genuinely want to. If you’re someone who offers help to others, this is a virtue you can recognize in others as well.</p>
<p className="tabbed">b. Once you accept help, you’ll notice that teamwork more often than not gives better results. #synergy</p>
<p className="tabbed">c. Help keeps you humble. You learn more about other people’s abilities and strengths that are different from your own which is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>3. <b>Change.</b> When you have every minute of the day planned and crammed with that never-ending to-do list, the inevitable unpredictable events will happen - especially in healthcare. You have two choices: accept it, or don’t. What I’ve learned is that if you resist change, you lose battles more often. This isn’t to say you need to be a yes-person and follow change blindly, but seek to understand its purpose and contribute to the change’s success.</p>
<p>4. <b>Self-doubt.</b> This one is hard. It’s uncomfortable. It makes me want to hide under my blankets and never come out. It multiplies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imposter syndrome</a>. Here’s what to do: lean into this feeling. It forces you to reflect what it is you’re doubting, and why. This is when I really need to rely on my support system. During one of my worst episodes of self-doubt, one of my residency mentors hugged me for a full minute in her office while I cried on her shoulder. After I let that out, she gave me an assignment. She had me write down 10 things that I liked about myself and was proud of. I could only think of 8, and she filled in the rest for me plus more. It wasn’t an instant fix, but it was the first step to pick myself up brick-by-brick and come out of it with more self-love and empowerment.</p>
<p>5. <b>Failure.</b> In residency (and in life), you will have failures. You will not reach one of your goals you set. You will get bad feedback from preceptors, some of which is non-actionable. You will make mistakes. When this happens, don’t hide from it. Don’t sweep it under the rug and pretend it didn’t happen. Don’t blame others. Instead, self reflect. Recognize what happened and how your actions may have led you there. Acknowledge how it could have been prevented and make it a lesson for your mental toolkit. Because the important truth is, you will fail again.</p>
<p>Despite all of the tough days, the stress, the breakdowns, the self-doubt, the wondering if I could finish; I can honestly say I don’t regret it. Without the experience I wouldn’t have hit walls, break through them, and rebuild a stronger ones. If you’re in a difficult phase of your life where you’re in a tunnel, I hope these can provide you with tools start seeing the light.</p>

<p>When researching some topics for Mental Health Awareness Day I came across the <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/publications/action_plan/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization Mental Health Action Plan</a> and am grateful for it. It impactfully puts into words and actionable objectives to improve mental well-being and recognizes it as a fundamental component of the definition of health.

<p>The world has a long way to go, but I encourage you to learn more about how to get started: from within. I’m not going to write too much here about what specifically is in this document because you should read it, but it starts by “Setting the Scene” in May 2012 when the 65th World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a resolution (WHA65.4) on the global burden of mental disorders at a country level. An action plan was developed that consists of a comprehensive, multisectoral approach that focuses on “promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, care, and recovery”.</p>
The action plan has four objectives:
<p className="tabbed">1. To strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health<br></br>
2. To provide comprehensive, integrated, and responsive mental health and social care services in community- based settings<br></br>
3. To implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health<br></br>
4. To strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health<br></br></p>
<p>The action plan also relies on six principles and approaches:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. Universal health coverage regardless of age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation<br></br>
2. Human rights<br></br>
3. Evidence-based practice, taking cultural considerations into account<br></br>
4. Life course approach (infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older age)<br></br>
5. Multisectoral approach (health, education, employment, judicial, housing, social, private, etc.)<br></br>
6. Empowerment of persons with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities to be involved in mental health advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, monitoring, research, and evaluation</p>
<p>The document outlines global targets and indicators for a percentage of countries to meet by the year 2020. I HIGHLY recommend you give this a read if you’ve recognized the importance of mental health action and need a place to start. If we complement awareness with action, we can build enough momentum to truly create change.</p>

And when wanting to look and feel polished for the day, chapped lips can get in the way. Cold and dry air of the coming seasons are the biggest culprits, but take control of your lip care today with these essential steps.</p> <a href="/articles/26">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/lip-care.jpg" alt="Lip Care" />
<p>Growing up in Florida, I never had issues with chapped lips since it was always humid. Moving to North Carolina and making it through my first fall and winter I had to quickly learn how to deal. I’ve had to run meetings and do presentations feeling insecure about the cracking and peeling of my chapped lips and it’s not fun. Not to mention, the vicious cycle of dryness, scabbing, cracking, peeling can be incredibly painful.</p>
<p>Here are the steps I use to prevent but also treat chapped lips when the air is dry:</p>
<p>1. <b>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.</b> This is key. Drink a lot of water throughout the day, especially when the air is dry. Any subsequent steps you take will simply be a bandaid for the core issue of your body (and skin) being parched.</p>
<p>2. <b>Exfoliate.</b> When I find that I’m in the cycle of scabbing and peeling, the best way to shorten the length of this is to exfoliate. Exfoliating the dead skin and scabs also allows your moisturizing steps to penetrate and heal. I have a jar of <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/face/lips/mint-julips/03057.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lush Lip Scrub in Mint Julips</a> but you can also make your own scrub at home with a <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/turn-lip-balm-into-lip-scrub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sugar/coconut oil cocktail</a>.</p>
<p>3. <b>Lip mask overnight.</b> I keep a jar of Vaseline/petroleum jelly next to my bed and lather up before I fall asleep. It does wonders to create a barrier while I’m sleeping and give my lips time to heal. When you apply, make sure you go beyond the lip area and also apply on the skin around it. Other options you may have around the house include coconut oil and olive oil, but I find that those don’t last overnight so my preference is the thicker Vaseline.</p>
<p>4. <b>Do not lick your lips.</b> When you lick your lips, the evaporation will also pull on what little moisture is in your lips and the skin around it, which worsens the situation especially in the skin around the lip area.</p>
<p>5. <b>Create lip barriers during the day.</b> Prevent the wind and dryness of the environment from having contact with your lips by creating a barrier throughout the day. I’ve found that even having a liquid lipstick on my lips is better than nothing at all when the air is extremely dry, but I generally use a lip balm. My everyday use is a lip balm like the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/agave-lip-mask-P384629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask</a> . It’s expensive, but lasts forever and works really well. Side benefit - it also tastes good!</p>

Why so early? Why is my pharmacist offering my flu shot? What’s the point if sometimes I still get the flu anyway? What’s herd immunity? All of those questions and more are answered here. </p> <a href="/articles/25">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/flu-vaccine.jpg" alt="CDC Flu Vaccine" />
<p>Photo credit: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) </a></p>
<p>As a pharmacist and healthcare professional, promoting use of vaccinations is a passion of mine. Since I was a student pharmacist I’ve been administering vaccines. Specifically, influenza (flu), herpes zoster, and pneumococcal. In North Carolina a trained and certified pharmacy student can administer certain vaccines under a precepting pharmacist supervision.</p> 
<p> I promoted the flu shot at NC State Fairs, when I worked at CVS, and at many community health fairs throughout my time at school. As I asked passersby about whether they wanted their flu shot, I got a lot of no’s. I would follow up by asking why not in an attempt to dispell any misconceptions about the vaccine. </p>
<p>Here are the most common questions/comments I’ve gotten over the past 6 years, along with my responses that will hopefully empower you to stay up-to-date on all of your vaccines.</p>
<p>1. <b>You’re a pharmacist, you can’t give me my flu shot.</b> Pharmacists are legally authorized in <a href="http://www.immunize.org/laws/pharm.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all 50 states and the District of Columbia</a> to administer vaccines. Which specific vaccine(s) and for what age(s) a pharmacist may administer varies by state, so ask your local pharmacist what he/she can offer you. As the most accessible healthcare professional, pharmacists are well-positioned to at the very least provide you with information regarding your vaccines.</p>
<p>2. <b>I never get sick, do why do I need the flu shot?</b> This can be answered by the concept called <a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herd immunity</a>. When you are getting a vaccine, you’re not just getting it for yourself, but you’re getting it for those with weakened immune systems who cannot get a vaccine (patients with cancer, post-transplant, newborns, etc.) With herd immunity, there is a saturation point where so much of a community is immunized that there is little opportunity for the disease to cause an outbreak. This principle is what has controlled contagious diseases like measles, mumps, polio, etc. that you rarely see in developed populations where vaccines are readily available. I’ve seen patients hospitalized for the flu because their immune systems were not strong enough to fight it. Trust me, at the very least, get the flu shot for them.</p>
<p>3. <b>It’s not even winter yet, why now?</b> Your body will finish creating its defenses, called antibodies, about two weeks after you receive the vaccine. During that time, you are still vulnerable to contract the flu, so it’s important to get the vaccine before peak season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends you get the vaccine <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/consumer/vaccinations.htm#when-vaccinate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by the end of October</a>. Many pharmacies and clinics begin offering the vaccine as early as September, so take advantage of this while you can.</p>
<p>4. <b>What’s the point, when sometimes I get the flu anyway?</b> There are a couple points here. First, it’s possible you contracted the flu while your body was still creating its defense mechanisms after your flu shot (see #3). Second, it’s impossible to know exactly which strain will outbreak each season. The flu shot is a combination of different strains from the prior year’s flu viruses that have the highest likelihood of being this year’s outbreaks. This means it’s possible that the vaccine is not covering the particular strain of flu you had. It is still important to get the vaccine each year because of <b>herd immunity</b> (see #2) and your body can still develop defenses for the strains within the vaccine.</p>
<p>5. <b>What if I’m allergic to eggs?</b> Most flu vaccines are manufactured using egg-based technology. A recent CDC study found the rate of allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to be only <b>1.31 per one million vaccine doses administered</b>. However, studies have shown that persons with a history of egg allergy (hives or otherwise) should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/egg-allergies.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still receive any flu vaccine that is appropriate for your age and health status</a>.</p>
<p>6. <b>Can my kids get the vaccine, too?</b> Yes! It is recommended that children start getting the flu vaccine every year starting at <b>6 months of age and older</b>. You can find a link to flu vaccine recommendations for every age, and what vaccine product is available <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6602a1.htm#T1_down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>You can get more FAQ’s answered for this <b>2017-2018 flu season</b> directly from the <b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website</b> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>It’s important to stay informed for your health and the health of your family and friends. The bottom line is that licensed healthcare professionals and evidence-based science are the strongest tools we have to make recommendations that benefit the health of society as a whole.</p>

But being able to run an efficient meeting is a key skill that optimizes productivity and demonstrates quality leadership. Become an expert by practicing these 10 Commandments of Meeting Management. </p> <a href="/articles/24">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/meeting-management.jpg" alt="Meeting Management" />
<p>As a Health-System Pharmacy Administration Resident, one of my longitudinal responsibilities was to run many different meetings. The size and exposure of these meetings ranged from small teams to department-wide, and everything in between. Part of the practice was to ensure we knew the necessary steps and consequences of ineffective meeting management. One of the biggest lessons for me was that ensuring an outcome of a group of people in one room at the same time is indeed a skill that takes practice and refinement.</p>
<p>Running a meeting ineffectively can decrease of morale for participants who feel they have wasted time, and build distrust in you as a leader. In order to avoid these consequences, we’ll discuss what I like to call the 10 Commandments of Meeting Management.</p>
<p>1. <b>Have the right people in the room.</b> Before you have any meeting, you must make sure that you have the people you need to make decisions. Know the purpose of your meeting and what you want to get out of it to understand the necessary stakeholders. Nothing is worse than pulling together a meeting and realizing you don't have a specific person to ensure an initiative can move forward. Keep in mind this may mean you need to reschedule a meeting if an essential team member can't make it. Everyone will appreciate this, and they may use the returned time to work on more internal components to your projects.</p>
<p>2. <b>Start on time.</b> If you're running a meeting, don't be late. In fact, early is on time. Not only does it give you a strong foundation to end on time but it is also respectful for everyone who is in attendance. Factor in time to travel from your previous location and time to set up necessary technology (see #4).</p>
<p>3. <b>Send out an agenda.</b> With that agenda, clarify the goal of the meeting for everyone in attendance. An agenda helps prepare attendees for the meeting, especially if you have others presenting besides yourself. Assign times for each agenda item to make sure you've picked the right length of meeting.</p>
<p>4. <b>Test the technology.</b> Most meetings now have both in-person and remote attendees. Get to the meeting room a few minutes early for set up if you are running a meeting. This may mean leaving your previous meeting early, but is much better for everyone involved not to spend half the allotted time figuring out technology.</p>
<p>5. <b>Designate sometime to take minutes.</b> If it is a small meeting, you can take minutes yourself if you wish, but I always recommend assigning it to someone else if possible. It can be difficult to engage in discussion and follow action items if you are also trying to type minutes.</p>
<p>6. <b>Manage the side conversations and off-agenda discussion.</b> If the discussion does not apply to the whole group or gets non-productive, you must step in as the meeting manager. Methods such as “parking” for the next meeting or discussing offline are essential. Parking refers to putting a topic aside for a separate discussion. It acknowledges the topic as appropriate for further evaluation, but not at the meeting at hand.</p>
<p>7. <b>Have follow up and assigned ownership.</b> By the end of the meeting, each agenda item should have a follow up task and assigned owner. Of note, the decision for an item to be tabled or parked for a later date does count. Action tasks and owners should be documented in the meeting minutes.</p>
<p>8. <b>Summarize action items before leaving the room.</b> You will have minutes, however the verbal reinforcement at the end of a meeting your opportunity to make sure that you and everyone else interpreted follow up items correctly.</p>
<p>9. <b>End on time.</b> This is as paramount as starting on time. Once there are 5-10 minutes left, acknowledge this and transition to discussing follow up items, including agenda points that need to be tabled for the next meeting.</p>
<p>10. <b>Send minutes within 3 business days.</b> The sooner you send minutes, the better because the meeting is still fresh in everyone’s minds. If there are actionable items people may be waiting for the minutes to know the assignments, especially if there were people unable to attend.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, time and productivity are important for everyone. Running an efficient and effective meeting demonstrates quality leadership. As a rule, if you have scheduled a meeting, assume you must be the one to get these things done unless told otherwise. Meetings can be your only opportunity to get key stakeholders in a room to push initiatives forward, and not taking advantage of these can be detrimental to the team. </p>

<img src="/images/shine-text.png" alt="Shine Text" />
<p>Happy October, everyone! The air in New York City is crisp and cool, and I’ve busted out my fall/winter clothes in preparation. However, just because a new month feels like a fresh start, Mondays still feel the same. It’s difficult to be motivated and all you want is to stay in bed in your warm blankets.</p>
<p>For years now, I’ve signed up for a motivational text service called Shine that was recommended to me by one of my residency preceptors. How it works:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. Sign up with your phone number <a href="http://www.shinetext.com/?r=88DMj2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. Receive a daily message Monday through Friday. I receive mine ~8:20AM each day.</p>
<p>It’s that easy! Messages include quotes, research-based articles, actionable tools, and more. Here are examples of some of my texts over the past few weekdays.</p>
<img className="cell-phone" src="/images/text-examples.jpg" alt="Text Examples" />
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it, residency was one of the most difficult periods of my life so far and I needed all the help I could get to stay motivated and build resilience. There were days the text was as if Shine knew exactly what I was going through that day. Some messages help validate some of my feelings when I was down but also empowered me to get out of my slumps and take risks.</p>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend adding it to your daily mindfulness routine for happiness and productivity.</p>

But before we get to October, here are my reflections on 5 things I loved in the month of September.</p> <a href="/articles/22">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/dallas-reunion.jpg" alt="Dallas Reunion" />
<p><b>Friends reunion.</b> In early September I traveled to Dallas, TX to reunite with my best friends from pharmacy school for the college football season opener between University of Michigan and University of Florida. It was the first reunion of all of us together in two years. I was so excited and happy to be with these ladies again along with our significant others and friends. It was a great group of people in one place and made my heart happy. Even if the Gators lost that day.</p>
<img src="/images/blind-date-book.jpg" alt="Blind Date Book" />
<p><b>Blind date with a book.</b> There was a festival on Columbus Avenue that my boyfriend and I explored and along the way saw an independent bookstore to explore. Inside were tons of books that I wanted and I love perusing the beautiful book covers. There was a section I saw with a bunch of books that were wrapped in brown paper and saw that it was an activity where you purchase a book based on seeing a list of similar ones. I love the spontaneity of the idea!</p>
<img src="/images/school-walks.jpg" alt="School Walks" />
<p><b>Walking kids to school.</b> Every morning I head to the train station on the Upper West Side and it’s nothing like how it is south of Central Park. Instead of the hustle and bustle of businessmen and businesswomen in suits with no room on the sidewalks, it’s the hustle of kids going to school. I took this picture because I thought it was so awesome that it was two parents (I’m assuming) taking their child to school. An ode to equal parenting roles.</p>
<img src="/images/holo-nails.jpg" alt="Holo Nails" />
<p><b>Holographic nail polish.</b> I bought some <a href="http://glistenandglow.bigcartel.com/product/glisten-glow-top-coat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glisten and Glow Top Coat</a> because it gets such rave reviews (side note: absolute game changer for nail-drying wait time), but I thought I’d try a holographic nail polish from the brand while I was paying for shipping anyway. So I got this one called Manis in Manhattan because I loved the pictures (and the name). When I put it on and it catches the light, it takes my breath away.</p>
<img src="/images/happy-hour-marg.jpg" alt="Margarita" />
<p><b>Happy hour independence.</b> I had an evening where I was meeting with an old co-resident who works in the City now too. I went to the place early, ordered a margarita, and had a seat by myself. When I grabbed a chair, I realized this was a significant moment. Years before I would have never thought to go to a restaurant by myself and sit alone in a place that was busting at the seams with people. What it told me was that I had come a long way to reach independence and confidence to do what I wanted. It was a great feeling.</p>
<p>September was a great month, but I must admit it was too hot. I’m so excited to see the leaves change in the City and experience my first fall. Bring it on, October!</p>

Welcome to my cozy Manhattan coffee shop on the Upper West Side, featuring the star of the show: AeroPress.</p> <a href="/articles/21">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/about-coffee.jpg" alt="National Coffee Day" />
<p>It’s National Coffee Day! I didn’t know that until the day before when I saw ads for Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc. I started drinking coffee my senior year of high school out of caffeine necessity, not taste enjoyment. The height of my coffee drinking was during a really bad stretch in my second year of residency when I had two Venti-sized coffees in a single day (twice daily dosing). I hope to never get to that point again. Since ending residency, I weaned myself down to one single cup each morning. I only had a few episodes of withdrawal headaches to get me to this point.</p>
<p>Moving to New York City, my boyfriend’s brother and sister-in-law said we needed to ditch the Keurig and get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a>. They pitched the space-saving benefits in preparation for no counter space. We didn’t subscribe to the idea immediately, but I did end up doing research comparing the <a href="https://coffee-brewing-methods.com/coffee-maker/aeropress-vs-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress with a French press</a>. I superficially wanted the French press initially because it looked prettier, but after reading reviews I learned that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a> has quicker brewing and better taste overall.</p>
<img src="/images/aeropress.jpg" alt="AeroPress" />
<p>Pictured above is our cozy Manhattan coffee shop, fully equipped with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a>, electric kettle, Trader Joe’s coffee, and honey. And it’s all that I need to get ready for the day! The night before I’ll make sure the kettle is full and cup is set up so all I have to do in the morning is heat up coffee, go to the bathroom, and by the time I’m done the water is ready to brew. I couldn’t be happier with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a> except that if you want bigger cups to fill. But luckily, it just takes another minute to make another cup.</p>
<p>I haven’t bought a coffee outside of Trader Joe’s replenishments for my home shop in weeks. When I was a resident I got up super early, or at least snoozed too much to have any time to make coffee, and went straight to the hospital half asleep, dropped by the 24-hour Starbucks thinking I was getting a deal with my employee discount. What a waste of money that was when I could have woken up 15 minutes earlier and made my own cup.</p>
<p>When I think back to the days of drinking tons of coffee just to make it through the day, it makes me all the more grateful for the phase of life I’m in now. I have weekends, I can leave my work at the hospital (for the most part), and I can do things I enjoy without feeling guilty. I don’t drink coffee out of necessity, but rather to kickstart my day the right way alongside breakfast and catching up on the morning news. It’s more social than survival, and that makes me happy.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/feminism.jpg" alt="Feminism" />
<p>I’ve mentioned before that I’m pretty new when it comes to feminism. I would say I “woke up” about two years ago, and new things are still becoming evident to me every day. I’ve embarked on the never-ending, ever-evolving journey of feeling self-empowered, and part of this is working on my feminism literacy by opening my eyes to the environment around me. If you’re new to feminism and wanting to find a place to start, this list will help give you a taste. With these, you can start dipping your toes in the water to question societal norms and begin changing the conversation.</p>
<p>1. <b>No trash bins in bathroom stalls.</b> This one just makes me think there wasn’t a woman at the table helping design the bathroom, when there definitely should be. And I also get frustrated that I have to take my tampons outside of the stall and put in a communal trash.</p>
<p>2. <b>Luxury tax on tampons.</b> Just… why? The only reason I (and even <a href="https://youtu.be/8c2Ro54Alkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a>) can think of is that only men were at the table when the tax laws were developed. Just in 2016 alone there was a large movement by states to make changes to this. You can read about those <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/08/the-tampon-tax-explained/?utm_term=.3ba757520b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<iframe width='480' height='290' scrolling='no' title="Tampon Tax" src='https://player.washingtonpost.com/prod/powaEmbed.html?adBar=true&autoinit=true&org=wapo&playthrough=true&uuid=1ba4f204-b5f7-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>3. <b>Dress code.</b> This is one I’ve been thinking a lot about recently after seeing a photo of a protest sign that said “<a href="https://thetab.com/us/2016/06/16/clothes-not-give-consent-16604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My clothes are not my consent</a>.” In high school I remember rules about whether I could wear spaghetti straps and not show any belly skin. In my opinion, these dress codes exist to not distract boys and men who “can’t help but look”. The very principle of this has roots in rape culture, slut-shaming, and body image woes.The concept of dress codes were recently challenged in the US Congress when an antiquated dress code was enforced about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40618356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing shoulders</a>, and some boys have joined to <a href="http://time.com/4829073/boys-skirts-protest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protest</a> in <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dress-code-protest-off-the-shoulder-tops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high schools</a> (this is what I like to see!).</p>
<p>4. <b>Need for paid family leave.</b> I believe this to be one of the largest contributors to gender inequality and institutional fostering of gender roles at a woman’s disadvantage. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</a> requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide job protection for 12 weeks unpaid leave. When I first learned about this through Human Resources Management training in residency, I had to ask again to clarify that it was <b>unpaid</b>. The instructor confirmed I heard correctly. I plan to have an entire post about research from other countries and current US states and large companies that are starting to catch up, but for now I’ll leave this video here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Paid Family Leave" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIllumeably%2Fvideos%2F267142393690868%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>5. <b>Marketing strategies to women.</b> I fully admit that I know when something is marketed to me that I feel a desperate want for, but most certainly don’t need. I’m at a point where I can recognize this and make choices whether to scratch that itch or not. However, in the big picture of things the market strategies create a female identity that automatically leaves each individual to counter and defend a particular market she doesn’t subscribe to. As women, we should be empowered to create our own identities and not be capitalized on by businesses trying to create our story. After all, we are the <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest consumers</a> in the market.</p>
<p>6. <b>Only “his” instead of “his or her”.</b> Whenever I read an article or listen to the TV, I’ve begun noticing every time a statement only has “his” instead of “his or her”. I’d be interested to see a book that wasn’t specifically about a woman that used “her” as the default.</p>
<p>7. <b>Importance of access to contraceptives.</b> Family planning allows women all over the world to make choices about her future. It saddens me that politics, religion, and sexism play a role in depriving women of making these choices on their own. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/melindagates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melinda Gates</a> has become someone I follow to stay informed about the need, especially in developing countries.</p>
<p><iframe title="Contraceptive Access" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmelindagates%2Fvideos%2F10155753603373072%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>8. <b>Changing last names after marriage.</b> I’ve started creating a database in my mind of women who changed their last name, hyphenated, or not changed at all. I’ve spoken with both men and women about what resulted after marriage with mixed responses for the reasoning behind their choices. The bottom line for me is that it should be a decision that is ultimately the woman’s choice.</p>
<p>9. <b>Masculinity.</b> I say a lot that I wish there was a different word for “feminism” because it truly is about challenging societal norms around gender identity as a whole. A lot of what plagues women today is an indirect result of the pressure society puts on men’s masculinity.  One of the biggest challenges for me is that men are (in general) raised to suppress emotion and thus equating emotion as weakness. This translates to men being emotionally unstable and can (in)directly affect treatment of women and also brand an “emotional” woman as weak.</p>
<p><iframe title="Masculinity" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbbctwo%2Fvideos%2F10155359731070659%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>10. <b>Intersectionalism.</b> I started hearing about this “third wave” of feminism being branded as <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/19/feminism-intersectionality-racism-sexism-class/96633750/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intersectional</a> and realized I needed to learn a lot more about it. A very basic understanding can be explained by the fact that women can have more or less disadvantage to find opportunity based a combination of her race, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, religion, economic class, etc. In the big picture of diversity around the world, people have different privilege and disadvantage depending on which intersection you are look into. In order to recognize these intersections we must first understand our own privilege. Then we can begin to disentangle a “woman” from an “African American woman” and from a “Muslim transgender woman”.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be man-bashing or diminish the struggles that men also go through. I simply seek to provide you with a starting place to open your eyes and see some of the most basic and common things that happen right under our noses may in fact be an opportunity to create positive change that benefits everyone. It’s as easy as staying curious, asking questions, and having a conversation.</p>

I propose we change the conversation to set boundaries instead.</p> <a href="/articles/19">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/boundaries.jpg" alt="Boundaries" />
<p>The constant battle of humans is to find balance in our lives with everything going on. The concept of having balance insinuates that within 24 hours of each day we must equally divide them between the activities we want to accomplish. 8 hours work + 8 hours play + 8 hours sleep. If we polled everyone in the world I would bet that is something less than 1% of the population actually achieves.</p>
<p>After 6 years of post-undergraduate school work, and the past two years as a pharmacy resident I am no stranger to the challenge of finding purpose in work and personal life when one held the keys to the future I need to pay of all of my loans and the other held the key to mental survival. I went through phases of being extremely UN-balanced and without ANY boundaries. I’ve attended seminars and read many articles about the art of finding balance, but the pursuit almost always leads to feelings of failure and disappointment.</p>
<p>Does that mean we are hopeless to never find balance? Are we doomed to lives of either all work or all play (and no sleep)?</p>
<p>Mentorship from those who also found balance a dead end goal has instilled in me the desire to dump the balance and instead set <b>boundaries</b>. Throughout residency I tried to set boundaries instead of balance. Many (MANY) times I failed, but I learned a lot along the way.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Set the boundaries.</b> You can’t ensure boundaries aren’t crossed if you don’t name them. Decide what time you want to turn the email off, when you want to go to bed at night, etc. Have a transparent conversation with your boss, teammates, and family about your boundaries and work with them through it. Embrace that you have needs – everyone does.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Be willing to change the boundaries fluidly.</b> Don’t feel guilty about needing to break your own “rules”. Boundaries are not set in stone, especially since rarely anything in life is. Similar to the first tip, should a change be needed due to current events in your life, keep having having conversation.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Have support structures around you to keep you accountable.</b> Surround yourself with people who enrich and fulfill your life, make you feel empowered to achieve your goals but also keep you in check when you’re falling into your Hobbit hole.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Start small.</b> Like any skill, it takes practice and strength to flex your boundary-setting muscles. Start by setting a boundary that isn’t threatening and incrementally raise the bar to others. For me, I started with not using my phone when I was out on a date with my boyfriend. One of the more challenging ones was not checking my email after 7:00PM.</p>
<p>The key here is to know that there will be times of imbalance in our lives and to make these choices with purpose. Be open and honest with your needs and this will take you far in your pursuit of boundaries.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/fall.jpg" alt="Fall" />
<p>As a Puerto Rican by birth, Floridian by childhood, Filipina by blood, I’m simply not made to love the cold weather. My blood is thinner and my biological thermometer is more sensitive (sounds scientific enough, right?) to any Fahrenheit readings below 75(ish) degrees. I grew up on the beachside of Central Florida, where there was no point in straightening your hair except for a few weeks in January (thank you, humidity), where freeze warnings meant bringing your plants inside overnight, and anything that required me to wear closed-toed shoes meant I was shivering.</p>
<p>That being said, I did live in North Carolina for 6 years as a warm up for New York City. One of the things people who know me are excited about seeing is my reaction to a Northeast winter. But that’s not for a whole season. We still have fall! If you know a Floridian, you’ve seen their wonder at the leaves changing to reds, oranges, and yellows. I still get these feelings 6 years later. But I have come to love a few more things that associate with the crisp, cool fall air that I’m excited to experience in New York City.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Pho.</b> Anyone else with me? I love a huge bowl of pho on a cool day to keep me warm from the inside.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Peacoats.</b> I didn’t own my first peacoat until I moved to North Carolina when I was 22 years old. But now that I have a few I love the style!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Leaves changing in Central Park.</b> As I said before, I still find the leaves changing to be one of the Wonders of the World. And in one of the best parks in the world? ‘Nuff said.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Not melting in the subways.</b> Subways don’t have air conditioning. They are about 50 degrees hotter than whatever temperature it is outside. You can do the math.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Fall makeup/nail polish colors.</b> I’m not one for makeup rules, but the muted warm tones and deep berry colors are some of my favorites to rock out on my lips, eyes, and nails in the fall.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Keeping windows open.</b> In our brownstone apartment, we don’t have central air conditioning. I’m pretty excited to remove our window units to make way for keeping the windows open. Thank you Upper West Side and your cleaner outside air.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Mulled wine.</b>I love making mulled wine. The temperature and spice warmth combined is perfect to cozy up with a movie on the couch. Friends optional. Here’s one of my favorite recipes from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/mulled-wine-recipe-1950801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ina Garten</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">8. <b>Apples.</b> Apple combined with cinnamon in any form during the fall is the best. Cider, pie, applesauce, apple butter, donuts... okay brb going to buy some apples.</p>
<p>Until next year, summer. You were a great one in 2017...</p>
<p>...I’ll be missing you more this winter.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/owned-introversion.jpg" alt="Owned Introversion" />
<p>For the first couple of decades of my life, I didn’t know I was an introvert. I just thought I was quiet and didn’t like crowds. Thinking back, I was always reading a book at Filipino socials, preferring to have one-on-one conversations at house parties, and never wanting to go out to the clubs in college (but I did it anyway). Once I got to pharmacy school I learned a lot more about introversion because of one professor who had all of us take the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myers-Briggs test</a> as a part of learning more about ourselves and how to work in teams.</p>
<p>Taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and reading the description of my results was like reading my biography. It felt like validation for the feelings and needs I’ve had growing up that I didn’t know how to express. This isn’t meant to sound dramatic because I’ve had a happy life and am fortunate to not have been bullied or anything like that, but understanding these things about myself, my introversion, was eye-opening.</p>
<p>Once I identified as an introvert, the journey to owning it and feeling confident about it was a different story. It still took a while for me to say no to certain social gatherings after a long day of class/work. It wasn’t until years later in residency where I reached a point (alongside everyone else) where if I didn’t own my needs, I would mentally break. I’m not saying everyone needs to reach a breaking point to know how to get what you want, but this is how my journey played out.</p>
<p>Now that I’m in my career, living on my own in a new city with my boyfriend, I have a clean slate. This is the first clean slate I’ve had with this newfound confidence and pride in my personality and my needs. If you’re in a similar boat as me and working on your own sense of self, here are six ways I’ve learned to own your introversion.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Understand your needs.</b> It took a while for me to realize that what seemed like quirks are really just facets of my personality and there is NOTHING wrong with it. Things that helped were reading books like Quiet, reading articles about other introverts like Eleanor Roosevelt, Warren Buffet, and Rosa Parks. I also have mentors who are introverts that have gone through a similar journey as me. Essentially, realize you are NOT alone and you are awesome as you are.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Acknowledge how your needs may be perceived.</b> Intention and perception are not always in sync. I’ve been told that I’m unemotional, seem uninterested, and like I’m blowing people off. Now that I understand more about myself, I don’t take offense to this. In fact, now I appreciate the feedback so I can 1) clarify and 2) make some adjustments by adding some explanation with my actions in real time. To the comments that I may seem unemotional/uninterested, I will clarify that I’m thoughtful and like to process before I share opinions. To the comments that I seem like I am blowing people off, I say that I’m actually just really worn out from the day and in order to feel well-rested the next day I need to stay in. The more we can help clarify how we are perceived, the more people will understand you instead of project judgement inappropriately (see #6).</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Be upfront with your needs.</b> Tell people that you’re an introvert and won’t necessarily go to all of the social events with your friends. Don’t apologize for it, be matter-of-fact with explanation (see #2). I’ve found that by doing this, it may inspire others to realize their own needs too.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Balance your relationships (i.e., have extrovert friends).</b> It can be easy for me to go unchecked with my hermit status if left to my own devices. If I surround myself with friends who appreciate my needs but also hold me accountable to getting out of the house, it becomes a much more healthy balance. Because as an introvert, I love my solitude, but I also love my friends and family.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Plan.</b> Being an introvert does not mean you are shy (you can be, of course, but they do not come hand-in-hand). If there is an event where you know you’ll be around a lot of people, have a lot of interactions, publicly speak etc. schedule time afterwards to have your solitary recharge. Take a bathroom break and relax for an extra minute or two. Block time off your calendar for yourself so no one else can book time in your office.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Educate others.</b> 99% of the time when I tell someone I’m an introvert, they’re surprised. Every time this happens, I see it as a perfect chance to advocate for understanding introversion. I explain how I am an introvert and that being an introvert does not mean a person is shy (among other things).</p>
<p>I hope these tips are helpful if you’re like me and feel that so much of social and business success is set up for extrovert success. I believe this balance is shifting little by little, but for the time being take these steps to own it!</p>

<p>When I was in residency, I worked every third weekend without a compensated day off. This meant 12 days straight of 10-12 hour workdays every third week. When you work weekends, the ones that you don't are essential to mental survival. And now that I’m in a position without working weekends, I’m still not used to the idea of truly being able to turn my brain off work at my own discretion. Here are 6 things I learned to keep in mind as I headed into a free weekend and prepared for the week ahead.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Go to bed and wake up at normal times.</b> Give yourself some liberty of course, but I find that when I succumb to the temptation of staying up late binge-watching Netflix and YouTube, I regret it the next morning. There are two possibilities: I wake up at early anyway because my body is used to it from the work week and am tired all day, or I wake up too late and lose half the day feeling groggy from oversleeping. Do yourself a favor and sleep at a normal time, but at least wake up while the sun is out.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>When you wake up, get up.</b> There's a lot of temptation to wake up and noodle around. Trust me, I've woken up and stayed in bed for hours and the next thing I know it's past noon and I'm starving because I haven't had breakfast and now I have a headache from caffeine withdrawal. Don't stray too far away from your usual morning routine and in fact supplement it with home-cooked breakfast and coffee with the TV on. The important thing is to get out of bed and don't go back for a while.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Prioritize.</b> While you have your morning coffee and catch on the TV shows you missed during the week, write down the list of things you want to do over the weekend, and the things you HAVE to do (not work-related). It sucks to get back to Monday not having done your groceries or bought more toilet paper when you had two free days to do it.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Schedule a microadventure.</b> This may require some pre-planning, or you could be totally spontaneous. Since I’ve moved to New York City, I subscribed to <a href="https://theskint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Skint</a> which is a daily subscription of low-cost and free activities going on in any of the 5 boroughs. I like to use it to get myself out of the house if there’s something I’m interested in. I find <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microadventures</a> a great mindfulness activity and distraction from checking my email.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. Do your self-care activities. This can be whatever you want. The important thing is to do it. You can check out my Sunday Self-Care routine <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. Unplug. Don't check your email for at least one of the days. I usually pick Saturday so that Sunday evening I can prepare for the week ahead. Practice mindfulness by minimizing your time on the devices and doing things like read a book, play board games, try a new restaurant, take a walk.</p>
<p>I hope these ideas help you maximize the free time you have on a weekend. It’s only 2 days for most of us, but there is so much you can do that has a huge impact on your resilience and mental health.</p>

<p>We all remember where we were that day. I was in 8th grade and had gotten to school early for a meeting for the Yearbook Club before first period. I did not see the first plane, but I did see the second plane because all of the TV’s in the school turned on immediately. And I remember watching the towers fall. Honestly, that’s all I can remember specifically. I don’t remember what I learned in school that day, or anything else afterwards.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, here’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_for_the_day_of_the_September_11_attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a> to serve as a reminder as we honor the lives who were lost, heroes who saved helped save lives by sacrificing their own, and citizens and leaders who helped rebuild the nation thereafter.</p>
<p>7:59 a.m.: American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:14: United Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and nine crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked over central Massachusetts, turning southwest.</p>
<p>8:20: American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and six crew members, departs 10 minutes late from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:42: United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 with 37 passengers and seven crew members, departs 42 minutes late from Newark International Airport, bound for San Francisco International Airport. Four hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:42–8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked above Albany, New York, about 140 miles north of New York City, turning south.</p>
<p>8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. The aircraft enters the tower intact.</p>
<p>8:50–8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked above southern Ohio, turning to the southeast.</p>
<p>9:03:00: Flight 175 crashes into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away.</p>
<p>9:28: Flight 93 is hijacked above northern Ohio, turning to the southeast.</p>
<p>9:37:46: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of The Pentagon and starts a violent fire.</p>
<p>9:59:00: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes after the impact of Flight 175.</p>
<p>10:03:11: Flight 93 is crashed by its hijackers and passengers, due to fighting in the cockpit 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes and were resisting the hijackers. The 9/11 Commission believed that Flight 93's target was either the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>10:28:22: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 1 hour, 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed.</p>
<p>10:50:19: Five stories of part of the Pentagon collapse due to the fire.</p>
<p>5:20:33 p.m.: 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story building, collapses.</p>
<p>Despite not remembering this timeline minute-by-minute, I remember the feelings I had, of fear and curiosity as to what was happening in the world. As an 8th grader the important things in my life were making sure I practiced enough for my piano lessons and when the next time I would talk to my crush was. I was just exploring things like makeup and hair straightening. Then something so significant happened in the world and I didn’t understand that it would cause a chain of events that would continue to affect my day-to-day now. I didn’t know at the time that I would live in New York City at Ground Zero and get to experience the memorialization of this day 16 years ago.</p>
<p>I learned what terrorism as an 8th grader. There are those around the world who learn what terrorism is before they even learn how to walk. Today, the threat of terrorism still exists but it has also empowered and strengthened the activism against it.</p>
<p>I value perspective and open-mindedness. The older I get, the more I see the definitions of “good” and “bad” are incredibly complex, and may not even exist at all in some cases. After moving from North Carolina to New York City, my eyes have opened further to the value diversity plays in peaceful co-existence. I hope to bask in it now, but wherever I go continue to spread the same beliefs. With diversity of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, comes a beautiful synergy of innovation and strength that the world needs more than ever.</p>

<p>Smoothies are one of my favorite ways to sneak nutrients into my body that I may otherwise not want to have by themselves because of taste, texture, etc. Here are 4 things I add into every smoothie I make that I don’t even notice are there but give me tons of added benefits.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Spinach.</b> I used to hate spinach, but now I love it. I get bags of them for salads, in sandwiches, cooked in pasta, and more. For smoothies, I’ll even use frozen spinach because I get some more bang for my buck that way. Spinach is an awesome source of vitamin K, vitamin A, iron, folate, vitamin B’s, fiber, and more. Pharmacist note: if you’re on warfarin, don’t change your spinach intake without letting your physician know because it may change your INR levels.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Flaxseed.</b> A bag of ground flaxseed lasts so for many smoothies. This is a great source of omega-3 essential fatty acids, fiber, and vitamin B1. Adding this to my morning smoothies definitely gets the intestines moving. One option is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DOKFLYI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DOKFLYI&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=c838e1986c6cf71ab89daf8347e46d5d" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum Essentials Organic Ground Flaxseed, 24 Ounce</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Chia seeds.</b> These are full of antioxidants, fiber, and protein. And they help thicken your smoothie, too! One option is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AQFGL3O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AQFGL3O&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=e9af5418f1a48916678a5bbbef92d5a7" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nutiva Organic Chia Seed, Black, 32 Ounce</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Kefir/Greek yogurt.</b> Kefir looks like milk but it’s so much more. It’s filled with nutrients (protein, calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin D) and probiotics that aid in digestion and the health of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Greek yogurt has similar benefits.</p>
<p>With these I get in a lot of nutrients and fiber I (unfortunately) don't in other meals of the day. I can't taste the difference except with the seeds but it doesn't feel any different than having some strawberries or kiwi. I hope you give these a try!</p>

<p>We all have goals for ourselves but many of us find ourselves unable to achieve them and feel too discouraged to persevere. I’ve been in that boat so many times. Each time I’ve not achieved a goal and reflect as to why, I realize that the reasons for not reaching my goals are not because of our innate skills but rather how we set our goals. Many of us set lofty goals for ourselves assuming setting a goal is all that's needed and the rest will naturally fall into place. “Dream big”, “Reach for the stars!” we hear.</p>
<p>I’m not saying not to reach for the highest heights in ourselves. However, setting goals that are actually achievable is vital for long term resilience and morale to reach the next one. One tool I was taught and now been using throughout my career for yearly evaluations is setting S.M.A.R.T. goals. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Specific.</b> This is the What, Why, and How of your goal.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Measurable.</b> Goals need to be measurable so you know that you have actually accomplished them.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Achievable.</b> You should stretch your limits with your goals but also set them with the appropriate level of knowledge and abilities to achieve them.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Relevant.</b> We can set goals that can be specific, measurable, and achievable, but without a strategic direction for ourselves, then we are treading water.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Time-Based.</b> Setting a timeframe creates a pragmatic sense of urgency between current reality and the goal.</p>
<p>To see the tool used through an example, we'll have one goal said with and without SMART methodology.</p>
<p className="tabbed"><b>Without SMART:</b> Read for pleasure more often.</p>
<p>What books define “reading for pleasure”? How will I know I’ve accomplished this? How many books in what frequency defines “more often”? Let’s try this again.</p>
<p className="tabbed"><b>With SMART:</b> Read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352153/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307352153&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=f67145ea9f2514d0cb2424ffdab01772">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</a> by the end of the September.</p>
<p>Here, you can see I’ve set a specific book and timeframe. Now that I’ve set this, I can figure out my pace to set sub-goals and make sure I’m keeping on track each week.</p>
<p>Once you set your goals, it's important to reflect at the end of each time period. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. What goals did I achieve? Celebrate these!</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. What goals did I not achieve?</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. Of the goals I did not achieve, what progress did I make towards them? Acknowledge and appreciate your progress.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. Of the reasons why a goal did not get accomplished, which reasons were under my own control?</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. Of the reasons that were under my own control, how can I improve for the next time to get closer to my goal?</p>
<p>Achieving our goals is an iterative process. Remember, life is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't beat yourself down if a goal isn't achieved at the exact time you allotted. Instead, see it as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I can’t believe it’s already the end of August. I know I’m in the majority of people feeling this way, but this has been a pretty big month for me with starting my first training-wheels-off job since residency. I’ve been learning to orient myself in a brand new environment and learning a new frontier in my pursuit of work-life integration. As I reflect on the past month before embarking on September, here are five things I loved in August.</p>
<h4><b>roses.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/anniversary-roses.jpg" alt="Anniversary Roses" />
<p>This August was my boyfriend and my two-year dating anniversary! I came home to beautiful roses and it reminded me of the roses he would get me on his walks home in our North Carolina neighborhood. We've had a lot of experiences in the past two years and he's put up with a lot of my stress during residency. Now that I'm into the next phase of my career and our lives in New York City I'm so excited for the future with my best friend.</p>
<h4><b>unlimited metrocard pass.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/metro-card.jpg" alt="MetroCard" />
<p>Once my job started I bought a 30-unlimited <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroCard</a> since I take a train to work every day. I'm grateful for the world of exploration the train opens for me. I'm able to get from one end to Manhattan to another in less than 30 minutes on a direct line and check out different boroughs. I love being able to ride the train to new adventures.</p>
<h4><b>citi bike.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/citi-bike.jpg" alt="Citi Bike" />
<p>Once I got a <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citi Bike</a> subscription the possibilities to explore grew even more. The bike allows us to go places that trains don't as conveniently (I.e, across Central Park) and with distances greater than I feel like walking in the New York City summer heat. At only $163/year for unlimited 45-minute rides, I can't NOT participate.</p>
<h4><b>clinique cheek pop in berry pop.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/clinique-pop.jpg" alt="Clinique Pop" />
<p>I've been experimenting with different parts of my makeup routine that I didn't used to do and now there are some I can't feel complete without. One of them is <b>blush</b>. I've had this product since my initial makeup-loving/self-empowerment phase began a few years ago and would use it sometimes but wasn't comfortable with it. Now that I've had more experience with different formulations I realize why it gets such good reviews. I love how buildable it is and lasts all day. Not to mention a gorgeous color!</p>
<h4><b>central park in the summer.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/central-park-summer.jpg" alt="Central Park Summer" />
<p>This place will forever have a special spot in my heart. I call it our back yard for good reason - it's a half an avenue away from our door. We've had access to it since the day we moved and it’s been a beautiful escape from our otherwise urban environment. The views, the bike rides, the fresh air, the free music, the free performances. I wanted to capture this moment because it represents our beginning here.</p>
<p>All in all, August was an amazing month. I started my career and this blog, I started a new life in a brand new place, and I'm continuing to find my ever-evolving sense of self. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me!</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of any makeup routine is eyeshadow. I don’t consider myself creative or artistic, but with eyeshadows I feel that I’m able to completely transform my look and feel more confident. Whether it’s a simple look while still half-asleep in the morning or ultra glam for a night out, I have a lot of fun doing it. <b>Remember: makeup should first and foremost be applied for you, not anyone else.</b></p>
<p>Here are my essential, everyday eyeshadows. These are the ones that I travel with and reach for with almost every look. These are basically my default shadows when I’m on autopilot. For reference, I’m a Filipina and have medium brown skin with neutral undertones (Mac NW44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast, Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan). I have very dark brown eyes and my eyelids get oily so I prime and set with a base every time.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/sunday-self-care.jpg" alt="Sunday Self Care" />
<p>Sundays are really important for me to feel I can tackle the week ahead. When I was a resident, the Sundays I wasn’t working were the days I felt I had control of my life. As transient as that feeling was once Monday hit, I still saw Sundays as a chance to start fresh. With the limited time to re-group, I developed the essential habits I continue to do now. Some of these may seem a bit *basic*, but I’ve learned that a compilation of what seem like little things become significant for self-care. You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for a massage and spa to reap the benefits (although, more power to you if can!). </p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Tidy the house.</b> It really is true that a tidy space helps develop a healthy mind. Don’t get me wrong, I am NOT a neat freak. I leave my clothes on the floor and don’t wash dishes immediately and never make my bed. But when clutter comes at the cost of not knowing where your essential things are and you create obstacle courses in your room, it can deter from the focus of your self-care routine. You can control the cleanliness of your environment, so take advantage of it and tidy up. I make it a Sunday morning ritual after breakfast and it sets a great stage for the rest of the day.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b> Meal prep.</b> Monday mornings are tough. Tuesday mornings are tough. Let’s face it, if you’re not a morning person then most of them are tough. I do as much as I can on Sunday’s to minimize the thinking I have to do each the morning. Sundays are usually one of my grocery days and it gives me a fighting chance to actually bring my lunch to work. In addition to preparing lunch, I also take the opportunity to cook a nice Sunday night meal. It’s a good mindfulness activity for me.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Weekly goals.</b> By the late afternoon I’m ready to check my work email and calendar. It’s important to be able to see the week’s landscape on Sunday while your mind has rested than on Monday morning when you’re expected to be “on” from the moment you step into the office. See what fires may be brewing for the week and what tasks must get done. By preparing on Sunday you’re able to be less reactionary to what is happening around you and take control of whatever situations arise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Nail care.</b> This is an example of one #treatyoself I like to do on Sundays when I have the time to paint my nails and not do anything for a while as they dry. Nail care is something that helps me to feel polished and confident. Treat yourself to what you enjoy to feel pampered and polished.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Skin care.</b> This is another example of my self-pamper regimen. I like to mask either with clay or a sheet depending on what I think my skin needs are. Putting on a mask is a mindfulness activity for me while doubling as skin care. It also helps me not look so tired on Monday morning (but coffee does this, too!). If you’re looking for a great, affordable, heavy duty clay mask, try out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014P8L9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014P8L9W&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=2cfe5b6a34a4eb1d543e9a60860fe801">Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay</a>. My boyfriend and I will do these masks together and our faces feel so soft and clean afterwards!</p>
<p>These are a few examples of little things you can do to feel empowered to kick ass and take names at work this week. The important thing is to find what works for you and dedicate to self-care.</p>

<p>I just finished my third week on the job. One thing I’m still getting used to transitioning from resident to full-fledged pharmacist is not feeling guilty about taking time to do things other than work. As a resident, there were usually so many things to get done that you didn’t know how to take a mental break. And if you made the choice to not work, many would feel odd about it knowing that there was someone else still working.</p>
<p>But now, living in New York City there is always so much to do right outside your door. I have no choice but to disconnect from work and enjoy everything around me. Here’s a taste of microadventures of the week.</p>
<img src="/images/nycfc.jpg" alt="NYCFC" />
<p>My boyfriend and I were given some tickets to a New York City FC soccer game in Yankee Stadium. It was a lot of fun! And I got to see the Bronx for the first time.</p>
<img src="/images/salmon-don.jpg" alt="Salmon Don" />
<p>We also tried a new spot on 82nd St. and Amsterdam Ave. called <a href="http://www.jinramen.com/uws_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > Jin Ramen</a>. I didn’t get ramen, I got the Sake Ikura Don (marinated salmon sashimi, salmon roe, daikon, kaiware, shiso leaf, shredded egg, nori, and zuke sauce). It was delicious! But I’m biasedRead More I love raw salmon.</p>
<img src="/images/eclipse.jpg" alt="Eclipse" />
<p>We weren’t in the “path of totality” here in New York, but we got to see a part of the eclipse! I was able to borrow someone’s eclipse glasses at work to see it. Seeing the totality videos were truly amazing.</p>

<p>After happy hour one night this week, the weather was perfect for a walk in Central Park. Made for a great photo, don’t you think?</p>

<p>My boyfriend and I went to a <a href="https://www.nycfc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New York City FC </a>
 soccer match in Yankee Stadium, and on the subway back home we had chatted with a small group of kids ranging from 4 to 10 years old (my guess). They started chatting with us asking if we went to a soccer game based on the crowd and our attire. We talked about the game and they asked how much it was. When we said some seats were only $10-15 they looked at each other in excitement and one said, “We can save up our money and go to one of those!” They were so curious about sports, who we were, what we were doing there.</p>
<p>With every response it seemed they realized we weren’t distant adults with no possible things in common, but rather were giving them glimpses of hope that they could be doing things just like us. Riding the train with these kids even just for a few minutes I felt happiness in their curiosity and hopeful in their untainted attitudes toward what was around them.</p>
<p>We reached the stop where we would transfer trains, which was the same stop these kids were getting off to go home. Our next train was already at the station and we eagerly pushed our way through the crowd to try to make it. When we made it across to the next train, we saw the oldest kid there keeping the door open for us! “I got you,” he said. He had our backs, and it was SO awesome.</p>
<p>The first thing my boyfriend said when we sat on our next train home was, “Those kids need to go to a soccer game.”</p>
<p>It was such a refreshing interaction to speak to these kids. In the whirlwind of politics, career, and trying to get our own sh*t together, we can forget that we have to foster the next generation, too. We have to make our surroundings better than how we found it (or made it) so that kids like the ones we met never lose hope in their own possibilities.</p>

<p>YouTube was founded in 2005 when I was a sophomore in high school(!). I still remember the yearbook that featured YouTube as one of the highlights of the year. My use of YouTube has evolved from primarily watching music videos to now being a source of anything I could think of. The first time I recall the concept of checking YouTube to learn how to do something was when my mom figured out how to fix some plumbing issues in our house while my dad was out of town. What a concept! But it wasn't until a couple of years ago I started using YouTube as my go-to for my visual/auditory learning needs. Below is a list of random things I've used YouTube to learn from.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>How to tie buttons back on your clothes.</b> I had a pile of clothes that I refused to throw out because of a popped button, but at the same time kept putting off actually learning how to do it. One day I thought, if I use YouTube for other things, why not this? It totally worked.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Excel functions.</b> I used these videos out of necessity during residency for my research and rotation projects. What I love about these are that they're usually voiceover style so I can use Excel and follow along the videos to know where to click/type at the same time.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>How to install a window AC unit.</b> This was a lifesaver when moving to New York City and cooled us down after a full day of driving and moving up 3 flights of stairs for a few hours. Instead of paying our apartment maintenance guy, I watched a video of how to do it and my boyfriend installed them. Turns out it's pretty easy!</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>New York apartment interior design.</b> When preparing to move to New York City, I was addicted to watching apartment tours to see how people stored and organized their things in a small space. This was a great way for me to get an idea of what could (and could not be) possible. I'll admit, I did some YouTube window shopping for penthousesRead More anything's possible, right?</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Piano.</b> This tip come from my boyfriend who taught himself some tunes via YouTube! I love listening to him play different songs especially knowing it was self-taught.</p>
<p>I hope these give you some ideas of YouTube lessons. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/college-self.jpg" alt="College Self" />
<p>This August is the first one in my life that I will not be having a "first day of school". It's crazy to think, but also refreshing to be able to focus on developing my career on the job. I've had first days with a lot of different academic environments. In high school I was a big fish in a small pond. In college I was culture-shocked as a tiny tadpole in one of the Great Lakes. In pharmacy school it was ~150 people in the same lecture room all day long. And then getting my MS, it was a whirlwind balancing evening coursework with a full residency program. Each environment had its own challenges that built from the previous experience, but I believe the hardest transition of all was the one from high school to college. It almost feels like an extension of your teenage years where you think you're invincible but at the same time feel pressured to be a completely functional #adult. What does that mean, anyway?</p>
<p>Below are 10 things I would tell my college self!</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Embrace not having things figured out.</b> College is a difficult time. You're trying to reconcile the structure you had in high school with the open freedom of living on your own for the first time. Throw in the highlight reels of social media and fantasy of TV shows/movies, and you have a perfect storm to create a ton of insecurity and identity crises. Now that I'm in my late 20's and just really getting going, I think back to my 18-22 year old time frame and think, "Man, I wish I had spent less time worry about finding my path and trying new things instead." You don't know what you don't know. Take advantage of it now so that when you have a lot more responsibility you will have the wisdom and perspective to ground you in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Fail.</b> This is something that may seem like a ridiculous tip if you're used to achieving everything you work towards. But by never failing, you don't develop the coping strategies to overcome the stumbles. In college, you have a lot of buffer around you that allows you to experiment and fail while still seeing the light of day. Reflect on what went wrong and what opportunities you could learn to improve. Have your support structure (mentors, family, friends) there for you as a sounding board (and shoulder to cry on). Know that you'll fail time and time again throughout the rest of your life. If you embrace it as a positive now and you will be able to develop building blocks of resilience in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Save money.</b> I'm hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with no savings account. When I think back of all that I splurged on and money I spent to eat out just because I was lazy, I realize how much I could have automated to my savings account and never touched. I could have been in a much more financially stable place now if I had basic financial advising right out of high school (if not earlier).</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Go to class.</b> I can't emphasize this enough. It's so easy to skip once you go to college and your parents aren't keeping you accountable. I don't care if you pay attention (although you should), but get yourself out of bed and into the classroom. Not only will it help you start making good habits, but you'll do so much better in that class just by being there and listening for key examination points. Go with a friend! Help each other with class attendance.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Take advantage of study hours.</b> In addition to going to class, if your class has homework assignments then go to study hours if you need help. Study hours are usually conducted by Teaching Assistants who have taken the class before, have an ear with the professor, helps write exams, grades exams, etc. Also, if you're like me and went to a large university with lecture halls filled with hundreds of students, study hours are a great way to get individualized attention to ask your questions in front of a smaller audience.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Stay in your dorms for at least a year.</b> I left the dorms after a few months because I was uncomfortable. I spent a lot of time off campus at other apartments because my friends were older. By doing this I missed out on organized social events on campus, meeting new people in the dorms, and learning to persevere through the discomfort. My recommendation: lean in to everything your campus has to offer in your first year. Apartments will always be there later.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Change your major.</b> The identity college students feel with their major is strong. It's essentially the equivalent to your name, since introductions always go to "What's your major?". The stamp of "Undecided" can feel like a dunce cap surrounded by people who seem like they have their lives figured out. The truth of the matter is, the major you have now may not land you the job you envision because you may change your interests, the workforce will change, and life will change. If you don't like what you're doing now after giving it a fair shot, take advantage of your resources and explore something new.</p>
<p className="tabbed">8. <b>Try a new hobby.</b> Campuses are full of clubs for anything you can think of. And if it doesn't exist, feel empowered to create it! Joining clubs and exploring hobbies are a great way to create balance in your life, have fun, and in some cases pursue leadership positions within the ranks.</p>
<p className="tabbed">9. <b>Learn to share spaces.</b> With the first taste of freedom of living on your own, it's easy to let go of the rest of your self-care. Make your bed, keep your room clean, wash your dishes, and maintain your regular hygiene. Odds are you share a space (dorm, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc.). It's important now to develop productive habits and make sure your cone of freedom doesn't interfere with anyone else's.</p>
<p className="tabbed">10. <b>Don't isolate your family.</b> If you're lucky, you made it to college with the support of your family in one way or another. In this phase of your life you begin to learn that your parents are human beings who went through similar struggles with their sense of self. Take advantage of their wisdom. If they don't treat you like an independent adult yet, give them time to also learn to let go. And never deny the gift packages from home. Your roommates/dorm-mates will appreciate it, too!</p>

<img src="/images/makeup-skin-foundation.jpg" alt="Foundation and Skin Type" />
<p>I fully admit one of my guilty pleasures is binge-watching YouTube "beauty influencers". Whatever your skin type is and daily routine, it takes trial and error to find out what works for you. The Q&A below is for reference for you to know it doesn't always have to be a 10-step foundation routine to look flawless. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of fun putting on makeup and when I know I have an evening event, I will plan to spend a lot of time on it. But for every day and getting ready for a long work day, what matters is what makes you feel comfortable and confident to take on your challenges.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin type?</b></p>
<p>I have oily skin, lucky me! I have occasional breakouts that leave pigmented scars. If you have oily skin too, I'm happy to share my tricks to controlling shine throughout the day. Hint - it starts with skin care.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin color and undertone?</b></p>
<p>I'm a Filipina and my skin color is brown with neutral undertones. For color reference, I use MAC NW 44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast (370), and Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan (320).</p>
<p><b>What tools do you use?</b></p>
<p>I've gone through a few different brushes, by my default brush to to blend out my foundation is the Morphe M439. I love how dense and short the bristles are and having the curved top as opposed to a flat top is more comfortable on the face. When I'm not too lazy to soak a Beauty Blender, I will use that too. But when I'm half awake in the morning on autopilot I pick up the brush.</p>
<p><b>How do you prep your face for foundation?</b></p>
<p>The very first thing I do when I wake up and before any makeup application is to wash it. I only do soap and water. I put on some lotion and wait 10 minutes, then I'm ready to go. This is usually when I start my coffee for the morning. As far as primer, I don't actually use those as much but I'm investigating some oil-control ones - stay tuned!</p>
<p><b>What do you use to set your face?</b></p>
<p>I keep it simple with powder to set the foundation. I find this to be essential if you have oily skin. Pictured is Estee Lauder Double Matte Oil-Control Pressed Powder in Medium/Deep (04). As you can see it's hitting pan and I plan to replace it with Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder next!</p>
<p><b>What are products you don't use every day?</b></p>
<p>When I'm getting ready for work in the morning, I keep it simple but effective. I don't use concealer under the eyes, instead I do a second layer of foundation. I don't use any sort of setting spray. And I don't contour/bronze. I am interested in pursuing this someday but for now, I only use blush and highlight.</p>

<p>One thing I learned quickly when moving to New York City was that brunch is a big deal. Every restaurant open has a brunch special of some sort. My boyfriend and I came up with our criteria for picking a place to actually stop and sit. Below are 4 considerations we have, along with some tips for the optimal experience in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Bottomless drink option vs. lower glass per glass.</b> Of course, drinks are the best part of brunch. There are options for a mimosa, blood Mary and bellini in many locations. Looking through different places there were some with $5 per drink options, and other discounted prices. But if you're not in a rush and you feel you'll drink more than 2 glasses, go for the bottomless option. With these morning cocktails ranging from $11-15, you can reap the benefits of the bottomless drink price after 2-3 drinks. Deciding between choices requires a little bit of calculation but worth the cost-savings in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Unlimited time for bottomless drinks.</b> If you find a spot with bottomless drinks, check the fine print. Some places will have a time limit to keep a table. This makes total sense from a business perspective, but as a consumer if you want to be somewhere for a few hours to optimize your cost per drink ratio, unlimited time options exist!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>See if you can eat at the bar.</b> In case you can't find a place that has unlimited time for your bottomless drinks, eat at the bar. This eliminates depending on your waiter/waitress for refills.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Research the menu.</b> This one is obvious. You'll want to eat with all of the bottomless drinks. Make sure the menu looks good!</p>
<p>Where's my favorite brunch place so far? In my neighborhood on the Upper West Side, that would be <a href="http://www.ellakitchenbar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ella Kitchen & Bar</a>. This place hit all of the criteria. Bottomless drink option between mimosa, bloody mary, bellini, and cava for $17 with no time limit that we could see on the menu (we stayed ~1.5 hours). We ate at the bar and our bartender didn't let our glasses empty. We were able to switch between types of drinks - not sure if this was a bartender perk, but it didn't state against it on the menu. And the food. was. delicious.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-cream-eggs.jpg" alt="Cream Eggs"/>
<p><b>Smoked Salmon Baked Eggs.</b>Three eggs, multigrain toast & home fries. Eggs are cooked with heavy cream & parmesan cheese. Smoked salmon with chives, dill & cream cheese. This was so sinfully good with the cream and cheeses. It came out on a cast iron platter, allowing the parmesan cheese to continue cooking into a delicious crust. The cream cheese was splattered in dollops and served as a scrumptious surprise since they were camouflaged with the cream and egg whites. I would order this every single time.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-wellington.jpg" alt="The Wellington"/>
<p><b>Wellington Eggs Benedict.</b>Poached eggs on house-baked English muffin, roasted chile hollandaise & home fries. Grass-fed skirt steak & sauteed spinach. My boyfriend got this meal, and let's just say there was no leftover. Can you blame him?</p>
<p>Where are your favorite brunch spots, and how do you pick them?</p>

One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it! Here are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months. </p> <a href="/articles/3">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/orienting-yourself.jpg" alt="First Day!"/>
<p>I started my first training-wheels-off job last Monday and most things are different from where I trained. The culture, the people, the protocols, etc. As a resident, I was one of the Chief Residents for Orientation where I helped coordinate on-boarding 35 Pharmacy Residents. With my specialty training I also coordinated on-boarding of new Managers while on rotations, and had lectures on the importance of getting a good start as part of my Masters degree.</p>
<p>An effective orientation is like getting a good first impression. It can say a lot about an institution's overall organization and how engaged your hiring manager is. A quality orientation experience can improve employee retention and engagement in the long run. This means less employee turnover and apathy, better team morale, and cost savings (training is expensive!).</p>
<p>With all of the didactic training and coordination of orientation schedules/experiences for others, it's time to create the effective experience for myself.  One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it!</p>
<p>Below are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months.</p>
<p>1. <b>Keep an open mind.</b> You don't know what you don't know. Seek to understand. All of these phrases basically mean, shut up and listen. Don't kid yourself thinking that you know, well, anything. It's a great place to be for now - embrace it.</p>
<p>2. <b>What got you here won't get you there.</b> Similar to the previous one, don't think that the knowledge you had that got you hired is what is going to make you the most successful. Keep your cards to yourself until you understand the organization first. Blow their minds with your abilities after you've earned their trust.</p>
<p>3. <b>Focus on building relationships.</b> You are not a one person show. If you are onboarding to a new organization, large or small, everyone has a place. And relationships are key. Get a feel for who you can go to for certain needs, who could be a mentor, and who can collaborate with in the future.</p>
<p>4. <b>Get lost.</b> Try to find places on your own (but don't be afraid to ask for directions so you're not late!). By walking places on your own instead of having someone escort you, you'll get lost less in the long run. And you may even find some secret spots to have lunch in solitude.</p>
<p>5. <b>Bring paper and pen.</b> It still sets a good first impression than taking notes on a mobile device. I always start with writing things down in my moleskin notebook until I see examples of otherwise.</p>
<p>6. <b>Under promise and over deliver.</b> Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. All of my mentors have advised not to join too many committees, promise too many deliverables to start, etc. Be a productive and effective team member and understand the culture/politics around you. When the time is right, flex your muscles.</p>
<p>7. <b>Trust the process.</b> Remember that while all organizations have room for improvement, you do not have the historical context behind decisions that give you the bandwidth to make any change recommendations just yet. Trust the process, keep notes of what went well and what didn't, and when the time is right discuss these opportunities with your hiring manager.</p>
<p>8. <b>Communicate.</b> Over communicate with your hiring manager. The more you communicate now, the more trust you will build with your boss. Communicate when you are unsure. You will likely have different people orienting you throughout the process and people will over- or under-assume you know anything. Tell your trainers upfront where you are in the process, and don't let them assume you know something you don't. On the other hand, don't let your trainers speak too long about things you already know because that wastes everyone's time. Speak up for yourself - this is your time and sets the platform for the rest of your time at the institution.</p>
<p>9. <b>Build good habits from day 1.</b> This is your opportunity to set your environment within appropriate bounds. Your email is empty so you can start your organization system from scratch. You can create your boundaries for working after hours/weekends now (unless your boss has different expectations). If you build good habits now, it will help in the long run for resilience in the workplace and happiness at home.</p>
<p>10. <b>Start with the basics.</b> Learn where the bathroom is, how to clock in, make sure you get paid.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to see if these tips worked for me in the long run. I hope some of these will work for you.</p>

<img src="/images/graduation-end.jpg" alt="graduation:" />
<p>I was raised in a family and culture where education meant success. If you did well in school, the rest of your life would fall into place. Well, I've gotten a lot of higher education throughout the past couple of decades with three degrees to my name (BS, PharmD, MS). And while I've held jobs as I progressed through my coursework, and staffed as part of my residency program, the graduation days have finally ended and the training wheels are off. At 28 years old, I officially have entered the next step of my career.</p> 
<p>What's funny about it is that I feel like I'm learning the same #adulting struggles now as those just finishing their undergraduate degrees. Except now I'm in much more debt and haven't been able to hold a saving's account because of school. Coming out of it and transitioning to the workforce, I wonder if it was worth it. At times I feel really behind after all of those long days, sleep lost, and money left on the table. I'm in my late 20's and just learning about 401k's, taxable income, and health insurance (despite being a healthcare professional). But at least I know how to cook?</p> 
<p>The truth is, without all of the experiences I had before today I wouldn't be exploring New York City with someone I love, with the potential for amazing new experiences ahead of us. Yes, I've spent a lot of my life studying and struggling, but I learned so much along the way. I learned a lot about life, what I want from it, and how to get it. I've gained independence and perspective that had I rushed out into the real world a decade earlier I may not have in the same way.</p> 
<p>What I've learned is that when the graduation days end, life is just beginning. There is still so much more to learn and I choose to see it as a fun challenge. If you're in a similar boat where you are coming into the workforce feeling behind, I encourage you to take on the challenge with a positive perspective. Take value in where you came from, the mistakes you made, and accomplishments you earned. Use them to take on the unknown future and make it what you want.</p>

<p>Welcome to Coffee Meets Polished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day, to when we have to go out into the world as our more polished selves.</p>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader.</p>
<p>I studied Biology at the University of Florida and moved to North Carolina for pharmacy school at UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. While in pharmacy school I led a Communications and Social Media Management team for a national pharmacy organization where I discovered a new skill set and creative avenue to engage audiences. We focused on sharing stories of other student pharmacists to create a national platform idea promotion and collegiality.</p>
<p>Once I became a licensed pharmacist, I stayed in Chapel Hill two more years for residency where I specialized in Health-System Pharmacy Administration (yes, that's a specialty). Residency was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
<p>Now I'm in New York City pursuing the next step in my professional career in a brand new environment but finally without the training wheels on. Luckily I get to have my love by my side, too. You'll get to meet him throughout the journey!</p>
<b>Ok, but why did you start this blog?</b>
<p>I created this blog to share my story in hopes that if others can relate, they realize they're not alone. I feel most myself when I wake up on a Saturday morning and drink coffee while catching up on my YouTube subscriptions. But I also feel myself in wedges and a blazer managing projects and taking care of patients. One cannot exist without the other. This blog represents my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration (not balance) of my personal and professional lives.</p>
<b>But, what do I get out of it?</b>
<p>It’s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you to create the necessary boundaries between home and work to maintain resilience and happiness. At a minimum, my goal is that you leave this page feeling happy with you who are. If I'm lucky, you'll feel empowered to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
