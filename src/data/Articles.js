<div>
<p>I can’t believe it’s already the end of August. I know I’m in the majority of people feeling this way, but this has been a pretty big month for me with starting my first training-wheels-off job since residency. I’ve been learning to orient myself in a brand new environment and learning a new frontier in my pursuit of work-life integration. As I reflect on the past month before embarking on September, here are five things I loved in August.</p>
<h4><b>roses.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/anniversary-roses.jpg" alt="Anniversary Roses" />
<p>This August was my boyfriend and my two-year dating anniversary! I came home to beautiful roses and it reminded me of the roses he would get me on his walks home in our North Carolina neighborhood. We've had a lot of experiences in the past two years and he's put up with a lot of my stress during residency. Now that I'm into the next phase of my career and our lives in New York City I'm so excited for the future with my best friend.</p>
<h4><b>unlimited metrocard pass.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/metro-card.jpg" alt="MetroCard" />
<p>Once my job started I bought a 30-unlimited <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroCard</a> since I take a train to work every day. I'm grateful for the world of exploration the train opens for me. I'm able to get from one end to Manhattan to another in less than 30 minutes on a direct line and check out different boroughs. I love being able to ride the train to new adventures.</p>
<h4><b>citi bike.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/citi-bike.jpg" alt="Citi Bike" />
<p>Once I got a <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citi Bike</a> subscription the possibilities to explore grew even more. The bike allows us to go places that trains don't as conveniently (I.e, across Central Park) and with distances greater than I feel like walking in the New York City summer heat. At only $163/year for unlimited 45-minute rides, I can't NOT participate.</p>
<h4><b>clinique cheek pop in berry pop.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/clinique-pop.jpg" alt="Clinique Pop" />
<p>I've been experimenting with different parts of my makeup routine that I didn't used to do and now there are some I can't feel complete without. One of them is <b>blush</b>. I've had this product since my initial makeup-loving/self-empowerment phase began a few years ago and would use it sometimes but wasn't comfortable with it. Now that I've had more experience with different formulations I realize why it gets such good reviews. I love how buildable it is and lasts all day. Not to mention a gorgeous color!</p>
<h4><b>central park in the summer.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/central-park-summer.jpg" alt="Central Park Summer" />
<p>This place will forever have a special spot in my heart. I call it our back yard for good reason - it's a half an avenue away from our door. We've had access to it since the day we moved and it’s been a beautiful escape from our otherwise urban environment. The views, the bike rides, the fresh air, the free music, the free performances. I wanted to capture this moment because it represents our beginning here.</p>
<p>All in all, August was an amazing month. I started my career and this blog, I started a new life in a brand new place, and I'm continuing to find my ever-evolving sense of self. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me!</p>

{id: "11", title: "Everyday Neutral Eyeshadows for Medium Skin", date: "August 29, 2017", category: "Beauty", post: 
<div>
<p>One of my favorite parts of any makeup routine is eyeshadow. I don’t consider myself creative or artistic, but with eyeshadows I feel that I’m able to completely transform my look and feel more confident. Whether it’s a simple look while still half-asleep in the morning or ultra glam for a night out, I have a lot of fun doing it. <b>Remember: makeup should first and foremost be applied for you, not anyone else.</b></p>
<p>Here are my essential, everyday eyeshadows. These are the ones that I travel with and reach for with almost every look. These are basically my default shadows when I’m on autopilot. For reference, I’m a Filipina and have medium brown skin with neutral undertones (Mac NW44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast, Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan). I have very dark brown eyes and my eyelids get oily so I prime and set with a base every time.</p>

{id: "10", title: "5 Ways to Sunday Self-Care That Doesn’t Break the Bank", date: "August 26, 2017", category: "Wellness", post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/sunday-self-care.jpg" alt="Sunday Self Care" />
<p>Sundays are really important for me to feel I can tackle the week ahead. When I was a resident, the Sundays I wasn’t working were the days I felt I had control of my life. As transient as that feeling was once Monday hit, I still saw Sundays as a chance to start fresh. With the limited time to re-group, I developed the essential habits I continue to do now. Some of these may seem a bit *basic*, but I’ve learned that a compilation of what seem like little things become significant for self-care. You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for a massage and spa to reap the benefits (although, more power to you if can!). </p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Tidy the house.</b> It really is true that a tidy space helps develop a healthy mind. Don’t get me wrong, I am NOT a neat freak. I leave my clothes on the floor and don’t wash dishes immediately and never make my bed. But when clutter comes at the cost of not knowing where your essential things are and you create obstacle courses in your room, it can deter from the focus of your self-care routine. You can control the cleanliness of your environment, so take advantage of it and tidy up. I make it a Sunday morning ritual after breakfast and it sets a great stage for the rest of the day.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b> Meal prep.</b> Monday mornings are tough. Tuesday mornings are tough. Let’s face it, if you’re not a morning person then most of them are tough. I do as much as I can on Sunday’s to minimize the thinking I have to do each the morning. Sundays are usually one of my grocery days and it gives me a fighting chance to actually bring my lunch to work. In addition to preparing lunch, I also take the opportunity to cook a nice Sunday night meal. It’s a good mindfulness activity for me.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Weekly goals.</b> By the late afternoon I’m ready to check my work email and calendar. It’s important to be able to see the week’s landscape on Sunday while your mind has rested than on Monday morning when you’re expected to be “on” from the moment you step into the office. See what fires may be brewing for the week and what tasks must get done. By preparing on Sunday you’re able to be less reactionary to what is happening around you and take control of whatever situations arise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Nail care.</b> This is an example of one #treatyoself I like to do on Sundays when I have the time to paint my nails and not do anything for a while as they dry. Nail care is something that helps me to feel polished and confident. Treat yourself to what you enjoy to feel pampered and polished.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Skin care.</b> This is another example of my self-pamper regimen. I like to mask either with clay or a sheet depending on what I think my skin needs are. Putting on a mask is a mindfulness activity for me while doubling as skin care. It also helps me not look so tired on Monday morning (but coffee does this, too!). If you’re looking for a great, affordable, heavy duty clay mask, try out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014P8L9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014P8L9W&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=2cfe5b6a34a4eb1d543e9a60860fe801">Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay</a>. My boyfriend and I will do these masks together and our faces feel so soft and clean afterwards!</p>
<p>These are a few examples of little things you can do to feel empowered to kick ass and take names at work this week. The important thing is to find what works for you and dedicate to self-care.</p>

<div>
<p>I just finished my third week on the job. One thing I’m still getting used to transitioning from resident to full-fledged pharmacist is not feeling guilty about taking time to do things other than work. As a resident, there were usually so many things to get done that you didn’t know how to take a mental break. And if you made the choice to not work, many would feel odd about it knowing that there was someone else still working.</p>
<p>But now, living in New York City there is always so much to do right outside your door. I have no choice but to disconnect from work and enjoy everything around me. Here’s a taste of microadventures of the week.</p>
<img src="/images/nycfc.jpg" alt="NYCFC" />
<p>My boyfriend and I were given some tickets to a New York City FC soccer game in Yankee Stadium. It was a lot of fun! And I got to see the Bronx for the first time.</p>
<img src="/images/salmon-don.jpg" alt="Salmon Don" />
<p>We also tried a new spot on 82nd St. and Amsterdam Ave. called <a href="http://www.jinramen.com/uws_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > Jin Ramen</a>. I didn’t get ramen, I got the Sake Ikura Don (marinated salmon sashimi, salmon roe, daikon, kaiware, shiso leaf, shredded egg, nori, and zuke sauce). It was delicious! But I’m biased... I love raw salmon.</p>
<img src="/images/eclipse.jpg" alt="Eclipse" />
<p>We weren’t in the “path of totality” here in New York, but we got to see a part of the eclipse! I was able to borrow someone’s eclipse glasses at work to see it. Seeing the totality videos were truly amazing.</p>
<img src="/images/evening-walk.jpg" alt="Evening Walk" />
<p>After happy hour one night this week, the weather was perfect for a walk in Central Park. Made for a great photo, don’t you think?</p>

{id: "8", title: "Seeing Good in the Next Generation", date: "August 25, 2017", category: "Life", post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/next-generation.jpg" alt="Next Generation" />
<p>My boyfriend and I went to a <a href="https://www.nycfc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New York City FC </a>
 soccer match in Yankee Stadium, and on the subway back home we had chatted with a small group of kids ranging from 4 to 10 years old (my guess). They started chatting with us asking if we went to a soccer game based on the crowd and our attire. We talked about the game and they asked how much it was. When we said some seats were only $10-15 they looked at each other in excitement and one said, “We can save up our money and go to one of those!” They were so curious about sports, who we were, what we were doing there.</p>
<p>With every response it seemed they realized we weren’t distant adults with no possible things in common, but rather were giving them glimpses of hope that they could be doing things just like us. Riding the train with these kids even just for a few minutes I felt happiness in their curiosity and hopeful in their untainted attitudes toward what was around them.</p>
<p>We reached the stop where we would transfer trains, which was the same stop these kids were getting off to go home. Our next train was already at the station and we eagerly pushed our way through the crowd to try to make it. When we made it across to the next train, we saw the oldest kid there keeping the door open for us! “I got you,” he said. He had our backs, and it was SO awesome.</p>
<p>The first thing my boyfriend said when we sat on our next train home was, “Those kids need to go to a soccer game.”</p>
<p>It was such a refreshing interaction to speak to these kids. In the whirlwind of politics, career, and trying to get our own sh*t together, we can forget that we have to foster the next generation, too. We have to make our surroundings better than how we found it (or made it) so that kids like the ones we met never lose hope in their own possibilities.</p>

{id: "7", title: "5 Things I Learned On YouTube", date: "August 24, 2017", category: "Life", post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/youtube-lessons.jpg" alt="YouTube Lessons" />
<p>YouTube was founded in 2005 when I was a sophomore in high school(!). I still remember the yearbook that featured YouTube as one of the highlights of the year. My use of YouTube has evolved from primarily watching music videos to now being a source of anything I could think of. The first time I recall the concept of checking YouTube to learn how to do something was when my mom figured out how to fix some plumbing issues in our house while my dad was out of town. What a concept! But it wasn't until a couple of years ago I started using YouTube as my go-to for my visual/auditory learning needs. Below is a list of random things I've used YouTube to learn from.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>How to tie buttons back on your clothes.</b> I had a pile of clothes that I refused to throw out because of a popped button, but at the same time kept putting off actually learning how to do it. One day I thought, if I use YouTube for other things, why not this? It totally worked.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Excel functions.</b> I used these videos out of necessity during residency for my research and rotation projects. What I love about these are that they're usually voiceover style so I can use Excel and follow along the videos to know where to click/type at the same time.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>How to install a window AC unit.</b> This was a lifesaver when moving to New York City and cooled us down after a full day of driving and moving up 3 flights of stairs for a few hours. Instead of paying our apartment maintenance guy, I watched a video of how to do it and my boyfriend installed them. Turns out it's pretty easy!</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>New York apartment interior design.</b> When preparing to move to New York City, I was addicted to watching apartment tours to see how people stored and organized their things in a small space. This was a great way for me to get an idea of what could (and could not be) possible. I'll admit, I did some YouTube window shopping for penthouses... anything's possible, right?</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Piano.</b> This tip come from my boyfriend who taught himself some tunes via YouTube! I love listening to him play different songs especially knowing it was self-taught.</p>
<p>I hope these give you some ideas of YouTube lessons. The possibilities are endless.</p>

{id: "6", title: "10 Things I Would Tell My College Self", date: "August 23, 2017", category: "Life", post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/college-self.jpg" alt="College Self" />
<p>This August is the first one in my life that I will not be having a "first day of school". It's crazy to think, but also refreshing to be able to focus on developing my career on the job. I've had first days with a lot of different academic environments. In high school I was a big fish in a small pond. In college I was culture-shocked as a tiny tadpole in one of the Great Lakes. In pharmacy school it was ~150 people in the same lecture room all day long. And then getting my MS, it was a whirlwind balancing evening coursework with a full residency program. Each environment had its own challenges that built from the previous experience, but I believe the hardest transition of all was the one from high school to college. It almost feels like an extension of your teenage years where you think you're invincible but at the same time feel pressured to be a completely functional #adult. What does that mean, anyway?</p>
<p>Below are 10 things I would tell my college self!</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Embrace not having things figured out.</b> College is a difficult time. You're trying to reconcile the structure you had in high school with the open freedom of living on your own for the first time. Throw in the highlight reels of social media and fantasy of TV shows/movies, and you have a perfect storm to create a ton of insecurity and identity crises. Now that I'm in my late 20's and just really getting going, I think back to my 18-22 year old time frame and think, "Man, I wish I had spent less time worry about finding my path and trying new things instead." You don't know what you don't know. Take advantage of it now so that when you have a lot more responsibility you will have the wisdom and perspective to ground you in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Fail.</b> This is something that may seem like a ridiculous tip if you're used to achieving everything you work towards. But by never failing, you don't develop the coping strategies to overcome the stumbles. In college, you have a lot of buffer around you that allows you to experiment and fail while still seeing the light of day. Reflect on what went wrong and what opportunities you could learn to improve. Have your support structure (mentors, family, friends) there for you as a sounding board (and shoulder to cry on). Know that you'll fail time and time again throughout the rest of your life. If you embrace it as a positive now and you will be able to develop building blocks of resilience in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Save money.</b> I'm hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with no savings account. When I think back of all that I splurged on and money I spent to eat out just because I was lazy, I realize how much I could have automated to my savings account and never touched. I could have been in a much more financially stable place now if I had basic financial advising right out of high school (if not earlier).</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Go to class.</b> I can't emphasize this enough. It's so easy to skip once you go to college and your parents aren't keeping you accountable. I don't care if you pay attention (although you should), but get yourself out of bed and into the classroom. Not only will it help you start making good habits, but you'll do so much better in that class just by being there and listening for key examination points. Go with a friend! Help each other with class attendance.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Take advantage of study hours.</b> In addition to going to class, if your class has homework assignments then go to study hours if you need help. Study hours are usually conducted by Teaching Assistants who have taken the class before, have an ear with the professor, helps write exams, grades exams, etc. Also, if you're like me and went to a large university with lecture halls filled with hundreds of students, study hours are a great way to get individualized attention to ask your questions in front of a smaller audience.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Stay in your dorms for at least a year.</b> I left the dorms after a few months because I was uncomfortable. I spent a lot of time off campus at other apartments because my friends were older. By doing this I missed out on organized social events on campus, meeting new people in the dorms, and learning to persevere through the discomfort. My recommendation: lean in to everything your campus has to offer in your first year. Apartments will always be there later.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Change your major.</b> The identity college students feel with their major is strong. It's essentially the equivalent to your name, since introductions always go to "What's your major?". The stamp of "Undecided" can feel like a dunce cap surrounded by people who seem like they have their lives figured out. The truth of the matter is, the major you have now may not land you the job you envision because you may change your interests, the workforce will change, and life will change. If you don't like what you're doing now after giving it a fair shot, take advantage of your resources and explore something new.</p>
<p className="tabbed">8. <b>Try a new hobby.</b> Campuses are full of clubs for anything you can think of. And if it doesn't exist, feel empowered to create it! Joining clubs and exploring hobbies are a great way to create balance in your life, have fun, and in some cases pursue leadership positions within the ranks.</p>
<p className="tabbed">9. <b>Learn to share spaces.</b> With the first taste of freedom of living on your own, it's easy to let go of the rest of your self-care. Make your bed, keep your room clean, wash your dishes, and maintain your regular hygiene. Odds are you share a space (dorm, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc.). It's important now to develop productive habits and make sure your cone of freedom doesn't interfere with anyone else's.</p>
<p className="tabbed">10. <b>Don't isolate your family.</b> If you're lucky, you made it to college with the support of your family in one way or another. In this phase of your life you begin to learn that your parents are human beings who went through similar struggles with their sense of self. Take advantage of their wisdom. If they don't treat you like an independent adult yet, give them time to also learn to let go. And never deny the gift packages from home. Your roommates/dorm-mates will appreciate it, too!</p>

{id: "5", title: "My Skin Type and Foundation", date: "August 19, 2017", category: "Beauty", post:
<div>
<img src="/images/makeup-skin-foundation.jpg" alt="Foundation and Skin Type" />

<p>I fully admit one of my guilty pleasures is binge-watching YouTube "beauty influencers". Whatever your skin type is and daily routine, it takes trial and error to find out what works for you. The Q&A below is for reference for you to know it doesn't always have to be a 10-step foundation routine to look flawless. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of fun putting on makeup and when I know I have an evening event, I will plan to spend a lot of time on it. But for every day and getting ready for a long work day, what matters is what makes you feel comfortable and confident to take on your challenges.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin type?</b></p>
<p>I have oily skin, lucky me! I have occasional breakouts that leave pigmented scars. If you have oily skin too, I'm happy to share my tricks to controlling shine throughout the day. Hint - it starts with skin care.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin color and undertone?</b></p>
<p>I'm a Filipina and my skin color is brown with neutral undertones. For color reference, I use MAC NW 44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast (370), and Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan (320).</p>
<p><b>What tools do you use?</b></p>
<p>I've gone through a few different brushes, by my default brush to to blend out my foundation is the Morphe M439. I love how dense and short the bristles are and having the curved top as opposed to a flat top is more comfortable on the face. When I'm not too lazy to soak a Beauty Blender, I will use that too. But when I'm half awake in the morning on autopilot I pick up the brush.</p>
<p><b>How do you prep your face for foundation?</b></p>
<p>The very first thing I do when I wake up and before any makeup application is to wash it. I only do soap and water. I put on some lotion and wait 10 minutes, then I'm ready to go. This is usually when I start my coffee for the morning. As far as primer, I don't actually use those as much but I'm investigating some oil-control ones - stay tuned!</p>
<p><b>What do you use to set your face?</b></p>
<p>I keep it simple with powder to set the foundation. I find this to be essential if you have oily skin. Pictured is Estee Lauder Double Matte Oil-Control Pressed Powder in Medium/Deep (04). As you can see it's hitting pan and I plan to replace it with Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder next!</p>
<p><b>What are products you don't use every day?</b></p>
<p>When I'm getting ready for work in the morning, I keep it simple but effective. I don't use concealer under the eyes, instead I do a second layer of foundation. I don't use any sort of setting spray. And I don't contour/bronze. I am interested in pursuing this someday but for now, I only use blush and highlight.</p>

{id: "4", title: "4 Considerations for Picking Weekend Brunch + My Favorite UWS Spot", date: "August 17, 2017", category: "Food", post:
<div>
<img src="/images/brunch-bloody-mary.jpg" alt="Bloody Mary" />
<p>One thing I learned quickly when moving to New York City was that brunch is a big deal. Every restaurant open has a brunch special of some sort. My boyfriend and I came up with our criteria for picking a place to actually stop and sit. Below are 4 considerations we have, along with some tips for the optimal experience in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Bottomless drink option vs. lower glass per glass.</b> Of course, drinks are the best part of brunch. There are options for a mimosa, blood Mary and bellini in many locations. Looking through different places there were some with $5 per drink options, and other discounted prices. But if you're not in a rush and you feel you'll drink more than 2 glasses, go for the bottomless option. With these morning cocktails ranging from $11-15, you can reap the benefits of the bottomless drink price after 2-3 drinks. Deciding between choices requires a little bit of calculation but worth the cost-savings in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Unlimited time for bottomless drinks.</b> If you find a spot with bottomless drinks, check the fine print. Some places will have a time limit to keep a table. This makes total sense from a business perspective, but as a consumer if you want to be somewhere for a few hours to optimize your cost per drink ratio, unlimited time options exist!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>See if you can eat at the bar.</b> In case you can't find a place that has unlimited time for your bottomless drinks, eat at the bar. This eliminates depending on your waiter/waitress for refills.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Research the menu.</b> This one is obvious. You'll want to eat with all of the bottomless drinks. Make sure the menu looks good!</p>
<p>Where's my favorite brunch place so far? In my neighborhood on the Upper West Side, that would be <a href="http://www.ellakitchenbar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ella Kitchen & Bar</a>. This place hit all of the criteria. Bottomless drink option between mimosa, bloody mary, bellini, and cava for $17 with no time limit that we could see on the menu (we stayed ~1.5 hours). We ate at the bar and our bartender didn't let our glasses empty. We were able to switch between types of drinks - not sure if this was a bartender perk, but it didn't state against it on the menu. And the food. was. delicious.</p>

<p><b>Smoked Salmon Baked Eggs.</b>Three eggs, multigrain toast & home fries. Eggs are cooked with heavy cream & parmesan cheese. Smoked salmon with chives, dill & cream cheese. This was so sinfully good with the cream and cheeses. It came out on a cast iron platter, allowing the parmesan cheese to continue cooking into a delicious crust. The cream cheese was splattered in dollops and served as a scrumptious surprise since they were camouflaged with the cream and egg whites. I would order this every single time.</p>

<p><b>Wellington Eggs Benedict.</b>Poached eggs on house-baked English muffin, roasted chile hollandaise & home fries. Grass-fed skirt steak & sauteed spinach. My boyfriend got this meal, and let's just say there was no leftover. Can you blame him?</p>
<p>Where are your favorite brunch spots, and how do you pick them?</p>

<p>I started my first training-wheels-off job last Monday and most things are different from where I trained. The culture, the people, the protocols, etc. As a resident, I was one of the Chief Residents for Orientation where I helped coordinate on-boarding 35 Pharmacy Residents. With my specialty training I also coordinated on-boarding of new Managers while on rotations, and had lectures on the importance of getting a good start as part of my Masters degree.</p>
<p>An effective orientation is like getting a good first impression. It can say a lot about an institution's overall organization and how engaged your hiring manager is. A quality orientation experience can improve employee retention and engagement in the long run. This means less employee turnover and apathy, better team morale, and cost savings (training is expensive!).</p>
<p>With all of the didactic training and coordination of orientation schedules/experiences for others, it's time to create the effective experience for myself.  One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it!</p>
<p>Below are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		1. <b>Keep an open mind.</b> You don't know what you don't know. Seek to understand. All of these phrases basically mean, shut up and listen. Don't kid yourself thinking that you know, well, anything. It's a great place to be for now - embrace it.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		2. <b>What got you here won't get you there.</b> Similar to the previous one, don't think that the knowledge you had that got you hired is what is going to make you the most successful. Keep your cards to yourself until you understand the organization first. Blow their minds with your abilities after you've earned their trust.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		3. <b>Focus on building relationships.</b> You are not a one person show. If you are onboarding to a new organization, large or small, everyone has a place. And relationships are key. Get a feel for who you can go to for certain needs, who could be a mentor, and who can collaborate with in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		4. <b>Get lost.</b> Try to find places on your own (but don't be afraid to ask for directions so you're not late!). By walking places on your own instead of having someone escort you, you'll get lost less in the long run. And you may even find some secret spots to have lunch in solitude.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		5. <b>Bring paper and pen.</b> It still sets a good first impression than taking notes on a mobile device. I always start with writing things down in my moleskin notebook until I see examples of otherwise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		6. <b>Under promise and over deliver.</b> Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. All of my mentors have advised not to join too many committees, promise too many deliverables to start, etc. Be a productive and effective team member and understand the culture/politics around you. When the time is right, flex your muscles.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		7. <b>Trust the process.</b> Remember that while all organizations have room for improvement, you do not have the historical context behind decisions that give you the bandwidth to make any change recommendations just yet. Trust the process, keep notes of what went well and what didn't, and when the time is right discuss these opportunities with your hiring manager.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		8. <b>Communicate.</b> Over communicate with your hiring manager. The more you communicate now, the more trust you will build with your boss. Communicate when you are unsure. You will likely have different people orienting you throughout the process and people will over- or under-assume you know anything. Tell your trainers upfront where you are in the process, and don't let them assume you know something you don't. On the other hand, don't let your trainers speak too long about things you already know because that wastes everyone's time. Speak up for yourself - this is your time and sets the platform for the rest of your time at the institution.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		9. <b>Build good habits from day 1.</b> This is your opportunity to set your environment within appropriate bounds. Your email is empty so you can start your organization system from scratch. You can create your boundaries for working after hours/weekends now (unless your boss has different expectations). If you build good habits now, it will help in the long run for resilience in the workplace and happiness at home.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		10. <b>Start with the basics.</b> Learn where the bathroom is, how to clock in, make sure you get paid.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to see if these tips worked for me in the long run. I hope some of these will work for you.</p>

<img src="/images/graduation-end.jpg" alt="graduation:" />
<p>I was raised in a family and culture where education meant success. If you did well in school, the rest of your life would fall into place. Well, I've gotten a lot of higher education throughout the past couple of decades with three degrees to my name (BS, PharmD, MS). And while I've held jobs as I progressed through my coursework, and staffed as part of my residency program, the graduation days have finally ended and the training wheels are off. At 28 years old, I officially have entered the next step of my career.</p> 
<p>What's funny about it is that I feel like I'm learning the same #adulting struggles now as those just finishing their undergraduate degrees. Except now I'm in much more debt and haven't been able to hold a saving's account because of school. Coming out of it and transitioning to the workforce, I wonder if it was worth it. At times I feel really behind after all of those long days, sleep lost, and money left on the table. I'm in my late 20's and just learning about 401k's, taxable income, and health insurance (despite being a healthcare professional). But at least I know how to cook?</p> 
<p>The truth is, without all of the experiences I had before today I wouldn't be exploring New York City with someone I love, with the potential for amazing new experiences ahead of us. Yes, I've spent a lot of my life studying and struggling, but I learned so much along the way. I learned a lot about life, what I want from it, and how to get it. I've gained independence and perspective that had I rushed out into the real world a decade earlier I may not have in the same way.</p> 
<p>What I've learned is that when the graduation days end, life is just beginning. There is still so much more to learn and I choose to see it as a fun challenge. If you're in a similar boat where you are coming into the workforce feeling behind, I encourage you to take on the challenge with a positive perspective. Take value in where you came from, the mistakes you made, and accomplishments you earned. Use them to take on the unknown future and make it what you want.</p>

<p>Welcome to Coffee Meets Polished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day, to when we have to go out into the world as our more polished selves.</p>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader.</p>
<p>I studied Biology at the University of Florida and moved to North Carolina for pharmacy school at UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. While in pharmacy school I led a Communications and Social Media Management team for a national pharmacy organization where I discovered a new skill set and creative avenue to engage audiences. We focused on sharing stories of other student pharmacists to create a national platform idea promotion and collegiality.</p>
<p>Once I became a licensed pharmacist, I stayed in Chapel Hill two more years for residency where I specialized in Health-System Pharmacy Administration (yes, that's a specialty). Residency was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
<p>Now I'm in New York City pursuing the next step in my professional career in a brand new environment but finally without the training wheels on. Luckily I get to have my love by my side, too. You'll get to meet him throughout the journey!</p>
<b>Ok, but why did you start this blog?</b>
<p>I created this blog to share my story in hopes that if others can relate, they realize they're not alone. I feel most myself when I wake up on a Saturday morning and drink coffee while catching up on my YouTube subscriptions. But I also feel myself in wedges and a blazer managing projects and taking care of patients. One cannot exist without the other. This blog represents my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration (not balance) of my personal and professional lives.</p>
<b>But, what do I get out of it?</b>
<p>It’s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you to create the necessary boundaries between home and work to maintain resilience and happiness. At a minimum, my goal is that you leave this page feeling happy with you who are. If I'm lucky, you'll feel empowered to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
