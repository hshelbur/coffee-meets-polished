	<p>In the past year as I've been expanding my feminist knowledge, I've gotten to know who some of the current feminist icons are and why. One of them I came to learn about was Cecile Richards, an activist who served as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/our-leadership/cecile-richards">president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America</a> starting in 2006 and stepped down this year after 12 years in the role. She came out with Make Trouble to share her lifelong journey of activism and resistance. Getting to see her and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/lcollinsp?lang=en">Lauren Peterson</a> during their book tour was an amazing experience. Reading the book was equally amazing, if not more. </p>

	<p>I mentioned Kinstugi Wellness by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://candicekumai.com/">Candice Kumai</a> in a recent post so I had to list her latest book here. It reads like a memoir of Candice's Japanese culture  in combination with comprehensive wellness. It's filled with recipes and paired with the written passages throughout the pages. The pictures were all designed and taken by Candice and you can tell she poured her entire heart and soul into this work of art. </p>

	<p>Not That Bad is a collection of essays that tackle rape, assault, and harassment,  edited and with an introduction by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.roxanegay.com/">Roxane Gay</a>. I've read two of her other books (with many more to catch up on), including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Feminist-Essays-Roxane-Gay/dp/006269569X/">Bad Feminist</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Memoir-Body-Roxane-Gay/dp/0062362593/">Hunger</a>.

	<p>I've spoken a lot about the International Women's Day event where Emma Gray promoted her book and organized a panel of other feminist icons to join her in a conversation. That book is Girl's Guide to Joining the Resistance: A Feminist Handbook on Fighting for Good and it is filled with <b>actionable</b> steps of getting involved to make change in the world. Inspired by the results of the 2016 presidential election, this book is intersectional, empowering, and focuses on the importance of <b>your</b> story. </p>

	<p>When I participated in my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2FVnQr0">first Women's March</a> this year, my mom knitted me a pussy hat.

Since I listen to them hours per day I thought I'd share some of my favorites in particular categories. <b>Next up: podcasts to keep up with current events around the world.</b> </p> <a href="/articles/favorite-podcasts-to-stay-informed">[Read more]</a></div>,

	<p>I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of the 24 hour news cycle. For a long time, I watched CNN in the mornings before work and when I got home for the day to catch up. Now I feel like it's all the same conversations and in order to fill the time between BREAKING NEWS! they're bringing in opinions instead of doing reporting to add more substance. Now, I'm not saying they are f*ke news by any means, but I was feeling the need to listen to grass roots reporting (if that's what it's called) that presents information more than conjecturing. That's when I found podcasts that gave me roundups of daily headlines or deep dive into a specific topic a couple times per week. Here are some of my favorite shows to listen to! Some release daily and some weekly. Some are your typical headline-concentrated updates but some are also deep dives into specific topics at a time. Let me know if any of these strike your fancy!</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily">NYT The Daily</a></b></h4>
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily">
			<img className="portrait" src="/images/thedailypodcast.jpg" alt="NYT The Daily" />
			</a>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>The Daily</b> (~25-40 minutes): These episodes deep dive into one topic that is timely and relevant. The host, Michael Barbaro does an amazing job with the podcast. Recent episodes have included "Cracking Down on Leaks", "The Narrowing Path to Asylum", and a five-part serices about the life and death of a Baltimore teenager. This show also wins "best sound design" award in my book.</p>
		<br></br>

			<img className="portrait" src="/images/todayexplainedpodcast.jpg" alt="Today Explained Podcast" />
			</a>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>Vox Today Explained</b> (~20-30 min): Similarly to The Daily, they deep dive into a specific topic per episode. These come out later in the day so you can listen on your commute home from work. Recent episodes have included "Little summer vampires", "Mo Salah will make you care about soccer", and "You're tariffing us apart". This show wins "best title puns" award.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.electorette.com/">The Electorette</a></b></h4>
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.electorette.com/">
			<img className="portrait" src="/images/theelectorettepodcast.jpg" alt="The Electorette Podcast" />
			</a>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>The Electorette Podcast</b> (~30-60 min): This could go into an "activism" section too but this is more news-related with timely conversations around politics, feminism, and resistance. The content has a feminist angle to current events and the host Jenn also interviews some really interesting people. These upload every 1-2 weeks. My favorite episode recently was "Truth Decay, Report by RAND Corp". She also interviews a lot of women running for office to discuss their platforms.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/still-processing">NYT Still Processing</a></b></h4>
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/still-processing">
			<img className="portrait" src="/images/stillprocessingpodcast.jpg" alt="Still Processing Podcast" />
			</a>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>Still Processing</b> (~45-60 min): These are weekly episodes with conversations surrounding current cultural events. This is one of my favorite podcasts of all time because of how they unpack topics. It helps me learn how to unpack complex and problematic situations for myself, too. Recent episodes discussed the need for bad women (in response to "Ocean's 8" premiere), the problematic assessments of Kanye West, and BeyChella. So, so good.</p>

			<img className="portrait" src="/images/smntypodcast.jpg" alt="SMNTY Podcast" />
			</a>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>Stuff Mom Never Told You</b> (~45-60 min): This podcast has been around for years and hosts have changed over time. It unpacks current events from a feminist lens. From Lisa Simpson to whiskey, and everything in between. They recently talked about Ireleand's fight for abortion access, gaslighting, and Kim Kardashian advertising for appetite suppressants.</p>

			<img className="portrait" src="/images/nprupfirstpodcast.png" alt="NPR Up First Podcast" />
			</a>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>NPR's Up First</b> (10-15 minutes): This along with The Daily are the two podcasts I listen to almost every morning on my way to work. I like to this one first, since it's a quick roundup of highlights from the day before. At 10-15 minutes an episode, I finish listening before I even get on my train sometimes. This podcasts wins "most succinct" award.</p>

Or, put another way, since I discovered I was feminist. I would consider myself a bad feminist because in that self-awareness and learning, I've made mistakes.

	<p>I've come a long way since I proclaimed myself as a feminist. Or, put another way, since I discovered I was feminist. It's been a year now since moving to New York City and in that time I have been to event after event of panels, book signings, protest marches, and more where I learn context and tools to be a better representation for my story and empower others'.</p>
	<p>I would still consider myself a bad feminist because in that self-awareness and learning, I've made mistakes. I've made assumptions due to my frustrations and biases. The <b>unlearning</b> is just beginning, but I hope these mistakes I share will help you on your journey to self-empowerment.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #1: generalizing men.</b></h4>
		<img src="/images/intlwomensday1.jpg" alt="Emma Gray Event" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.uospaces.com/ninety8/williamsburg-ny">Space Ninety 8</a> in Williamsburg, NY at their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.uospaces.com/ninety8/en/williamsburg-ny/blog/posts/uo-happenings-international-womens-day-celebration">International Women's Day event</a>]</p>
	<p>I heard first from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.elizabethplank.com/">Liz Plank</a> during a panel in Williamsburg promoting Emma Gray's book <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amzn.to/2JOyJf7">A Girl's Guide to Joining the Resistance</a>, that it's not just women against the patriarchy. <b>It's men AND women against the patriarchy</b>. This is something I had to learn as my awareness grew. When my eyes started opening to the grand scale inherent biases and institutionalized sexism, it was like realizing I was in the Matrix. One of the big reasons my eyes started opening was because I was in a relationship with someone who took advantage of my lesser developed confidence and strength and used it as a power play for his misogyny. For years, I thought that this would just be the life I would live because... why not? And now that I'm in a much healthier relationship with someone who is feminist I'm realizing that men suffer from patriarchy too. Men suffer from the infrastructure created by patriarchy that stigmatizes them for showing sadness or fear and doesn't support extended paternity leave. There are many men that are bad. But not all men.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #2: judging.</b></h4>
		<img className="portrait" src="/images/katiecouric.jpg" alt="Katie Couric Event" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://thewing.com/">The Wing</a> to view Katie Couric's documentary series <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/america-inside-out-with-katie-couric/">America Inside Out</a>]</p>
	<p>When I first started unpacking a lot of inequality I was angry. This phase of awareness does that. You start seeing so much more than you never realized was there, or realized was sexist. You start realizing the infrastructure there that prevents progress. And you realize that it’s not just infrastructure but culture and upbringing that allows people to be complicit with the inequality. There were lots of occasions where my anger and judgement got the better of me. I didn’t consider the conditioned biases by others to have certain view points. Certain things are not necessarily someone’s “fault” they believe but they are a product of society. It doesn’t make it right but rather the energy to make progress can be better served in other ways than anger and judgement towards these people.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #3: quick to anger.</b></h4>
		<img className="portrait" src="/images/intlwomensday2.jpg" alt="Emma Gray Event" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.uospaces.com/ninety8/williamsburg-ny">Space Ninety 8</a> in Williamsburg, NY at their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.uospaces.com/ninety8/en/williamsburg-ny/blog/posts/uo-happenings-international-womens-day-celebration">International Women's Day event</a>]</p>
	<p>I've spoken a lot about anger. The basis of a lot of these mistakes is my quickness judgement that results in the emotions of anger and frustration. The consequences of this is not taking the step to <b>empathize</b> which prevents me from getting my point across productively and the anger clouds my ability to understand the other opinion. Whether I agree with someone or not, there is a point where we must agree to disagree. This is an importnt point to remember when we consider our own self-care when fighting the good fight. It's okay to be angry. In fact, healthy levels can help fuel your cause. But don't let the levels get so toxic that you undermine your own mission by cutting everyone out with anger.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #4: not being intersectional.</b></h4>
		<img className="portrait" src="/images/pussyhat1.jpg" alt="Women's March Pussy Hat" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo featuring my mom protesting at the Women's March in my hometown on the left, while I protested in New York City on the right]</p>
	<p>Intersectionality is one of the more recent learnings I've had that is being dubbed one of the newer "waves" of feminism. There are perspectives that argue its roots but I am not going to claim that level of understanding/expertise. What I do know is that one experience does not apply to all, and there are many reasons for this (race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, etc.). I even came to realize that my own intersections are part of my story. If we want to progress forward and shift the conversation and culture, considering intersections are essential. Part of this for me is understanding the biases that come with being both a woman and a person of color.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #5: not applying context.</b></h4>
		<img className="portrait" src="/images/gloriasteinem.jpg" alt="Gloria Steinem" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.albertine.com/events/festival-albertine-2017/">Festival Albertine 2017: Feminism Has No Boundaries</a>, a series of events curated by Gloria Steinem ad Robin Morgan]</p>
	<p>The next phase, after awareness, has been <b>learning history</b>.  Not only does intersection matter, but context and history matters. For me, this is more related to those who I disagree with. It has taken time to understand that there is a spectrum of people who are truly, actively bad versus being a product of the society he/she grew up in as I mentioned before. This understanding has allowed me to start with giving someone the benefit of the doubt that they are able to engage in healthy discussion or debate. Not only does context help with these situations, but also realizing how far we have actually coming. I've been incredibly lucky to attend events with feminists like Gloria Steinem and Cecile Richards. Their decades of experience and continued hopefulness while fighting help me remain optimistic that even if we still have so long to go, we've made a ton of progress. </p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #6: pushing my opinion.</b></h4>
		<img src="/images/thewinghandmaids.jpg" alt="The Wing Handmaid's Tale Event" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://thewing.com/">The Wing</a> with a panel of actresses from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hulu.com/the-handmaids-tale">The Handmaid's Tale</a>: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/amandabrugel/?hl=en">Amanda Brugel</a> (Rita) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/madbrew/?hl=en">Madeline Brewer</a> (Janine)]</p>
	<p>Realizing all the things that are wrong makes it easy to want to “fix” it with argument and logic. Or what I believe to be logical argument. Honestly, this journey has had me question what is truly "right" and "wrong" and needing to stay true to oneself is a large part of growing through this existential phase. Pushing your opinion onto someone too aggressively can cause the opposite effect. It can make someone close up and, whether conscious or not, make it harder to accept future related opinions. The reality is, if someone is not ready to accept your opinion, or at the very least willing to listen then you should table the conversation. This is not to say to give up, but in this fight for empowerment you have to also remember self-care and re-direct your energy in more productive, fulfilling ways.</p>

	<h4><b>mistake #7: fighting.</b></h4>

	<p>This isn't what you think. I'm not saying that I regret fighting. This is actually to say that one of my mistakes was thinking that I need to fight 100% of the time. Self-care is important. We must take care of ourselves before we take care of the world around us. Roxane Gay recently wrote a piece in response to someone feeling guilty for being tired and not fighting. It is titled, "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/opinion/sunday/ask-roxane-activism-idealism-apathy.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Froxane-gay&action=click&contentCollection=opinion&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection">Ask Roxane: I'm Outraged, but Failing at Activism. Why?</a>" and is a must-read (as is all of her other work). Her response is better than my brain could create.</p>

	<h4><b>mistake #8: preaching to the choir.</b></h4>

	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://thewing.com/">The Wing</a> to view Katie Couric's documentary series <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/america-inside-out-with-katie-couric/">America Inside Out</a>]</p>
	<p>I'll never forget the moment I realized that men needed to be part of the conversation of feminism if we were going to continue progressing to equality. When I was in the last month of residency, I put together a lunch with the female managers in the department for my female co-resident and I to gather their wisdom as we transition to leadership roles in our respective jobs. When I told one of my male co-residents he said that lunch sounded really beneficial and asked if he could join too. This moment continues to have a strong impact on my deliberate inclusion of all genders to the conversation of feminism.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>mistake #9: feeling judged.</b></h4>
		<img className="portrait" src="/images/cecilerichards.jpg" alt="Cecile Richards" />
	<p className="centered">[Photo taken at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://thewing.com/">The Wing</a> as part of Cecile Richard's book tour for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Trouble-Standing-Speaking-Lead-My/dp/1501187597">Make Trouble</a>]</p>
	<p>On the other end of the judgement spectrum, I was hesitant to state I was a feminist or speaking about my stances on feminism in the beginning. I felt that I would be judged or labeled and not known for my thoughts and views but instead the larger feminist movement reputation (negative one). I also felt that since I was so new to these views that I needed to learn more about the facts and history and context (see #5 and #6) in order to combat any naysayers or opposite opinions. It wasn't until I learned a lot of history and facts that I realized what mattered most was <b>my experience</b> and <b>my story</b>. Once I embraced my "why", no one could touch me. I now stand strong with my beliefs and fight for them by standing up for myself and empower others.</p>

	<p>If you've been following me for any amount of time, you may already know that I'm just wrapping up my first year on the job since completing a pharmacy residency. Most residency programs finish up at the end of this month, so I wanted to share some of the best ways to optimize this exciting [and scary] transition time. Some of you will have 4 to 6 weeks between ending residency and first day of orientation. This is valuable time to reset and recharge. Not finishing residency?

		<br></br>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
		<br></br>
		<h4><b>be mindful of your finances.</b></h4>
	<p>The hardest part of this time was the lack of income. With the resident salaries and loan payments it was impossible for me to have any savings. Luckily, my boyfriend who I moved with had enough savings to get us through while he also didn't have a job. But instead of relying solely of his savings, I also opened a new credit card that had a period of no interest so I could still enjoy my time off but not be penalized with high interest while I paid the minimum until my first paycheck came. I would recommend you have a serious look at your own finances to see if this is an option you want to consider.</p>
		<br></br>
		<h4><b>get to know your new surroundings.</b></h4>
	<p>And even if you're living in the same place as you did in residency (or previous job), you have a brand new [free!] lens to look through. Go outside and walk  around without Google Maps. Get lost. Find your coffee shop to spend Sunday mornings. Find your grocery story and nearest gas station. Find your happy hour spot. This is the time to find those things so that when you're done with a long day of work, you don't have to think too hard.</p>
		<br></br>
		<h4><b>take a trip.</b></h4>
	<p>Taking a nice trip is a great way to reset your mind and think forward. It can be hard to stop thinking about residency (or previous job), especially if you are still in the same place. Of course, be mindful of your finances for this but if you have the time [and potentially credit] this could be an option for you. I personally did not take a trip, but considered being a tourist in New York City to be more than enough to count.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>embrace boredom.</b></h4>
	<p>At this point you're used to having something to do at all times. The time between residency and your first day of orientation will have lots of times to do nothing. You may even feel bored! Embrace this. Channel it toward figuring out your new self-care routine and REST. For me, I didn't get out of bed until almost noon for many days. I sat in silence in my living room and read a book. I took walks in Central Park. I did a lot of nothing, too.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/First-90-Days-Strategies-Expanded/dp/1422188612/">The First 90 Days</a>.</b></h4>
	<p>This will be the only thing I recommend that is related to work. Highly recommend reading this BEFORE you start. If you read before you start work, it'll help you strategize how to make the most of your orientation period. This will help set a strong foundation for your productivity, relationship with your boss, and your role within the team. </p>

	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
		<br></br>
	<p>The general theme of these tips is to close one chapter and look forward. Don't burn bridges with your past, but in order to optimally start the next chapter it's important to have closure and reset your mindset.</p>

	<p>"A podcast for the modern day Asian American woman hosted by Melody Cheng, Helen Wu, and Janet Wang. We started this podcast as an outlet for topics we are interested in, and for sharing stories we have as 20-30 something yr. old Asian American women working, dating, and living in Los Angeles."</p>
	<p>I discovered this thanks to Apple's recommendation during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and have been hooked ever since. They're currently between seasons but are staying really active on their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/asianbossgirl/">Instagram Stories</a> still to give fun behind-the-scenes of their lives until next season starts. What I love about this podcast is the discussions about their Asian American identities. They talk about everything from being raised by Asian parents to dating, and as a Filipina American I find the topics extremely relatable.</p>

	<p>I started following Rachel on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theconfusedmillennial.com/">The Confused Millenial</a> at least a year ago and her blog is amazing. Its content is important, high value, and honest. And the aesthetic is gorgeous. When she announced she would be starting a podcast I knew it would be just as great.

	<br></br>
	<p>"A podcast for smart millennial women who are skeptical of the traditional personal development space. As a feminist life coach, I believe every woman has their truth to tell and together we’ll find strength in sharing and listening to them. Each week, I’ll share what’s on my mind in the form of a personal essay, often taken directly from the pages of my journal, then we’ll hear from the guest of the week. These guests bravely step up to the microphone for an interview to embody the core values of Wild Cozy Truth: that there is strength in vulnerability, courage in using your voice, power in community, and that authenticity is always the best policy."</p>
	<p>This may sound silly, but I feel like Renee and I could be coffee buddies if we lived in the same area. The content she shares in her essays are similar to my thought patterns, and her conversations with guests are spectacular and engaging. She brings in guests with diverse backgrounds who also have their own platforms so it's a great synergistic promotion while also digging deep into some not-so-common topics. After just a few episodes of listening, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wild-cozy-truth-renee-m-powers-podcast-for-smart-millennial/id1271855135?mt=2">Wild Cozy Truth</a> has become one of my favorites of all time.

	<p>Introversion, feminism, and leadership. How much more perfect a combination could there be for a listener like me? I would love for Morra to be one of my life and career mentors. She deep dives into topics that are perfect for the ambitious, creative, multi-hyphenate introvert. I was hooked from the title of her show, considering as an introvert I have on a not-so-rare occasion hid in the bathroom to avoid small talk.</p>

She's even more amazing in person and when she announced her podcast on her <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/candicekumai/">Instagram</a>, I immediately subscribed. It's brand new, but her first two episodes she's set the stage for quite the story through her life and career journey. I'm definitely hooked to hear and learn from her experiences.

		<p>1. Run a 5K in Manhattan - <b>COMPLETE!</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I proudly completed my first 5K without stopping to walk back in March, and have already signed up for my second race in June! My time for the 5K was 34:56 minutes at a 10:31 minute/mile pace. The race felt great, like I could have run faster, but my goal was to finish without walking and I'm really proud of myself for it. How I felt running during the race was proof that the training paid off. My race in July is for a 4-miler, and this will be the longest I've run since the 5K!</p>
		<p>2. Travel out of the country twice - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I went to Barcelona this month! As far as the second international trip, that's still being planned out but it will hopefully be during December.</p>
		<p>3. Participate in a protest/march - <b>COMPLETE!</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed"> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2FVnQr0">Women's March</a>. 'Nuff said. ✓</p>
		<p className="tabbed">[RELATED] <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2FVnQr0">Everything You Need To Know About The 2018 Women's March</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">In April, I also witnessed the March for Our Lives. I didn't walk in it, but instead made efforts to amplify the voices of those marching. I was live-tweeting protest signs and listened to the program at the start of the march. It was incredibly inspiring to hear stories of survivors and see how intersectional the protest truly was.</p>

		<p>4. Submit 10 essays/articles for websites - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">This month I'm officially changing this to "in progress"! I found a website that is accepting articles that I have two I would love to revamp for submissions. More to come!</p>
		<p>5. Take a creative writing course - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Still not progress for this. Some options I could pursue are Lynda.com or even Coursera. Do you any of you readers have suggestions?</p>
		<p>6. Learn how to curl hair with a curler - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">No change from last month. While I haven't purchased a curler, I stopped straightening or blowdrying for the past month and embracing the waves. I found that a lot of my resistance to curling was simply not being used to seeing my hair with more volume. But I'm learning about a whole new group of hair products I've never used before.</p>
		<p>7. Pay more rent than student loan bill each month - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Completed this one so far every month! Six more months to go… (and many more years).</p>
		<p>8. Wear more lipstick - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">When I was looking through the goals at the middle of the month, I saw that I had dipped on this in April and realized I hadn't much in the first part of May either. This was likely because half of it was spent traveling and I go pretty minimal with makeup when I do. So I made conscious efforts for the second part of May and have loved adding the colors back with the new season. </p>

		<p className="tabbed">I've now finished 3 products so far! If you're interested in me writing a post about what my 18 products are, leave me a comment below!</p>
		<p>10. Explore all of the New York City boroughs - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed"> Two boroughs down, no change from last month! I went to Brooklyn again mainly. Next month I may have some friends come to visit that will want to go to Queens. More to come!</p>

		<p className="tabbed">This one is a bit more difficult. I didn't gain any new subscribers as I have been focusing so much on social media. I know that this is something to have a stronger focus for in this next quarter.</p>
		<p>14. Reach 500 followers of Twitter - <b>COMPLETE!</b></p>

		<p className="tabbed">April was an exciting month to rejuvenate this goal. YouTube was one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2KwUgtX">Things I Loved in April</a> because I discovered so many new channels that showed me how much opportunity there is to be unique and individual on the platform.

	<p>Mother's Day is always a great time to honor and remember everything your mother did to raise you and instill her legacy within you. This was also my little sister's very first Mother's Day and it made me sad not to be in the same place to celebrate with both of them! Grateful for technology to at least see their faces.</p>

	<p>One of my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2mCwVg9">19 Before 2019 goals</a> this year was to travel out of the country twice, and this month I reached 50% completion going to beautiful <b>Barcelona</b>! I was there with my boyfriend for a whole week and didn't leave the city, so we really got to immerse and sometimes even run out of things to do. But all of the ups and downs in activity levels made for a well-rounded experience and we were quite well-rested by the time we got back (besides the jetlag). We did some "typical" touristy things but also lots of non-scheduled meandering throughout the city. It helped to already have city legs living here in NYC and the weather was beautiful for being outside as much as possible. I'm definitely still on this travel high and already looking for the next country to explore.</p>

	<p>May was Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and it was also a month I realized how much I need to actively maintain this part of my identity if it is to live on in the next generations of my family. Being in a mixed race relationship, the only way for it to live on is through my teaching of my heritage to my partner and actively incorporating it into my every day life. Some steps I plan to take include learning how to make some Filipino dishes to make at home. We've been able to eat at restaurants and my family will cook the dishes when we visit, but I personally don't know how to make any. One step at a time!</p>

	<p>Having friends come to visit is always great! And it's even better when it's to visit a city that's filled with fun things to do. I spent the Memorial Day weekend with a friend I've known since high school and her boyfriend. It was quite the action-packed weekend with happy hours, brunch, comedy show, Broadway play, and lots of good food. We even got to sneak in some amazing nighttime city views from the 30 Rock!</p>

	<p>May is my birthday month! This year I turned 29, which is makes me that much close to 30. I'm actually excited to reach my 30's. Not to say that I want to speed up time, I'm pretty happy being the present. What I mean to say is I'm not afraid to age anymore. My 20's were challenging and just as confusing - if not more so - than my teenage years. There was so much self-doubt, burnout, toxic relationships, that now that I'm reaching the end of the decade I feel so much more empowered after figuring out exactly who I am. And now that I'm here, I'm ready to empower others.</p>

	<h4><b>I didn't cry.</b></h4>
	<p>When you're expecting, you read A LOT of birth stories. Stories where new mamas have these amazing emotional experiences delivering their newborn baby. Being pregnant for the first time, I expected everything I read to happen to me. I wanted to feel overjoyed the second they placed my son on my chest. I wanted to smile wider than I ever have. I wanted that to be the happiest moment of my life at that time. But I didn't cry. I honestly felt no emotion. In that hour of skin-to-skin my hospital gave me immediately following delivery, I opened my heart and my mind, but no emotions came. Only thoughts.</p>
	<h4><b>Am I enough?</b></h4>
	<h4><b>How will I take care of this innocent child when I barely know how to take care of myself?</b></h4>
	<h4><b>What have I gotten myself into?</b></h4>
		<br></br>
		<img src="/images/ZEKE PIC 1-1.jpg" alt="ZEKE PIC 1-1.jpg" />
		<img src="/images/ZEKE PIC 1-2.jpg" alt="ZEKE PIC 1-2.jpg" />
		<br></br>
	<p>I stayed at the hospital for three days and two nights following delivery. Honestly, the whole stay was a blur, but one moment sticks out to me to this day. Around 2:30AM on the second night, my night nurse shook me awake because baby was crying. I didn't say it, but all I could think was, "can't you do it?" And then I remembered that was my responsibility now. That was MY baby - but I wanted nothing to do with him.</p>
	<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml">Postpartum Depression</a>, or PPD, is no joke. They warn you about it at your pre-partum monthly check ups. But you know you're strong and something like that will never get to you - until it does. It hits you like a brick. You tell yourself that you can do this and fight it but instead are faced with deteriorating mental health due to PPD. It affects all women differently. Some women refuse to hold their baby. Some women isolate themselves from all their loved ones. Most women become anxious, have mood swings, and cry uncontrollably for long periods of time. I was the anxious one. I cried a lot. Luckily, for me it didn't last that long. For some women it lasts for a few months.</p>
	<p>Five months later, I have a chunky baby boy that's already getting too heavy for me to carry. He is healthy and is sleeping. He's beginning to laugh and interact with us. Every smile that I see, every time he grabs my finger, every moment he's peacefully asleep reminds me that it was all worth it, that I can do this. I wouldn't have been able to get through it without the support from family and friends who were with me every step of the way. My son gives me purpose. He is a little ball of joy that I am blessed to wake up to in the morning and put to bed at night. I made it through.</p>

	<h4><b>To the significant other:</b></h4>
	<p>There is no way for you to understand what she is going through, and that is okay. Constantly remind her that you're there for her, even if you can't relate to the emotions. You must be the stability that she lacks in these times.</p>
	<h4><b>To the friends and family:</b></h4> 
	<p>Keep up with that mama that you know. She may isolate herself; it may seem like she cut you out of her life. Even the simplest reminder that you are still there for her can move miles.</p>
	<h4><b>And last but not least, to the mamas:</b></h4>
	<p>Don't worry, it WILL get better. It's okay to cry, it's okay to feel the way you do. But I urge you not to hold it in. Find at least one person you can trust with your feelings and vent to them. Just power through and even if you don't understand the cards you've been dealt, you will soon; and you are blessed.</p>

	<p>Today I enter the last year of my 20's. My 20's had a whole lot of changes and a lot of things that I thought were identity that turned out were toxic. I had a lot of burn out and growth, and now that I'm reaching the 29 I'm start to feel like the 30's are really going to be my prime. Not what you thought you'd hear from someone finishing her 20's? I'm here to bust some myths you may have heard about this decade of your life.</p>

	<h4><b>academic success translates to work/life success.</b></h4>
	<p>While I believe we must practice lifelong, continuous learning, the 20's is when many of us will finish school if that is the path we chose. I happened to extend my classroom schooling until I was 28 years old because I followed the path to being a healthcare professional - specifically pharmacy. It meant 4 years of Undergraduate Degree, 4 years of Doctorate of Pharmacy, and 2 years of a Master's Degree in Health-System Pharmacy Administration.</p>
	<p>This past year I finally had my first year outside of the classroom since I was in preschool. I felt so behind being in the "real world" for the first time. I'm still just learning about finances because I was mostly on loans for living expenses with a part-time job for personal expenses. I just started learning about picking insurance plans including health care plans despite being in the health care field. Honestly, I still don't know how to find a primary care doctor or a dentist and I desperately need both. </p>
	<p>The lesson to unlearn here is that very little of what I learned in the classroom prepared me for the practical things in life. I spent so much of my time training and that I essentially that I feel that it delayed my "adulting". I have a LOT of knowledge in my career field but this doesn't automatically mean I know how to set myself up practically for a long life ahead of me.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h4><b>unless you do it in your 20's, you lose your chance.</b></h4>
	<p>I don't exactly know from direct experience whether this is actually a myth since I'm still technically in my 20's. However I'm basing this on fact that I'm turning 29 and feel like my life is just starting. The biggest piece of advice I would say is to take every fork in the road, whether it's in your 20's or later, with a strategic mindset and have an idea of your long term goals. While the chance may not come again in the exact way as originally presented I do believe that there is more than one path to the same place. And by the time the chance presents itself differently, you may be in a different place.</p>

	<h4><b>you're supposed "settle down" by having a kids and owning a home.</b></h4>
	<p>I haven't talked a lot about my past relationships, but I was in a relationship for 6 years that ended in the middle of pharmacy school. I was in my mid-20's when this happened and my family was worried I would be unmarried for the rest of my life, that it was too late to start a new relationship, and that I would end up alone. More on that later and my mentality towards that, but that turned out not to be true. I'm in a relationship now and unmarried without kids. It likely won't happen before I turn 30 because that would make age 29 quite a year. But I went from a relationship that I thought would be it since we were together for so long, to coming to terms with being alone and thriving through it before finding a much healthier relationship.</p>
	<p>As far as owning a home, I actually do have a mortgage. It's disguised in the form of <b>student loans</b> and instead of a house I have a piece of paper with my name on it that allows me to practice as a licensed pharmacist. And instead of a house I live in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City (for rent). Loans suck, but I'm not feeling compelled to buy a house anytime soon.</p>
	<p>One battle at a time.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>you're only going to make it if you have a high-paying job.</b></h4>
	<p>I have a job that means I can live comfortably in New York City in my own apartment, but there were costs that came with it. The cost of time, the cost of debt, the cost of identity while training. What does it mean to "make it"? I'm almost 30 and I'm still figuring that out.</p>

	<h4><b>it's when you figure everything out.</b></h4>
	<p>I've learned that as you get older, you don't figure everything out. You just have more coping mechanisms to fake it better when you don't. You ideally gain the humility to ask for help when you don't know something. You understand the synergistic value of working collaborati And on the other end of the spectrum, what you DO figure more out is who you are. Your 20's test so much of your identity because you have more awareness of the world around you since now it's affecting you directly.</p>

	<h4><b>your life is over at age 30.</b></h4>
	<p>Have I debunked this with the prior answers yet? Society has you internalize (mostly women) that life is over at age 30. But in reality your thirties is MID-LIFE for many of us! My life personally is just beginning. I have a new job in a new city, a relationship with a great partner, and I'm free of school.</p>
	<p>I can't wait for my 30's! But for now, I'll soak in 29 one day at a time.</p>

If you've been following me for a while on this site, Twitter, or Instagram you know that podcasts are my thing. On Instagram Stories I share a lot of what I'm currently listening to and more immediate recommendations. Here, I share my monthly faves. Since I had marathon listening sessions on my 9-hour flights I thought I'd try something a little different and give you a run-down of all of them and how I rate them. </p> <a href="/articles/plane-podcasts-barcelona-edition">[Read more]</a></div>,

	<p>I thought I would do something a little different with the podcast recommendations this week. I recently got back from a trip from Barcelona with 9 hours of plane travel to and from, resulting in quite the podcast-listening marathon. I realized that with my monthly favorites I wasn't sharing the ones I was lukewarm about or didn't really like at all. If you like or dislike this kind of format please let me know! My goal is to start having more nuanced podcast posts here on Coffee Meets Polished.</p>
	<p>On the way to Barcelona I did a combination of podcasts and movies, but the return flight I listened exclusively to podcasts. The reason for return flight podcast marathon was actually because they didn't have a TV on my United Airlines flight despite it being a 8+ hour international flight. You were able to access movies and shows through the United website on your personal device, which was a chore in itself. But, I digress…</p>
	<p>Here are the podcasts I listened to while in airports and on planes to and from Barcelona. They are divided by channel and rated from 1-5. Loosely, this is my rating criteria at the moment:</p>
		<p className="tabbed"><b>✔︎ Strongly do not recommend.</b> Disliked to the point where I couldn't finish the episode and unsubscribed from the channel.</p>
		<p className="tabbed"><b>✔︎✔︎ Do not recommend.</b> Disliked to the point where I could finish the episode but didn't take anything from it.</p>
		<p className="tabbed"><b>✔︎✔︎✔︎ Neutral recommendation.</b> If you like this topic, you may enjoy it more that me. It may have been more informational vs. inspirational.</p>
		<p className="tabbed"><b>✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎ Recommend.</b> This would be a candidate for a monthly favorites post. It was entertaining, and/or took points away from the episode that I could apply to my life or share with others.</p>
		<p className="tabbed"><b>✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎ Highly recommend.</b> This would be in a monthly favorites post. I was very entertained and/or felt inspired and empowered to share with others to listen to immediately.</p>
		<p className="tabbed">A <b>(*)</b> denotes that this was the first episode I've listened to for the podcast channel.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-introvert-dear-podcast/id1375366625?mt=2">The Introvert, Dear Podcast</a>*</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Episode #002: Why You Don't Need to Apologize for Being an Introvert (39 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  I loved this episode because while I'm becoming more and more well-versed in introvert nuances, I was still able to take a lot away that was tangible and applicable to my life. Whether you're an introvert or extrovert, it's a great listen. I can't wait to see what other episodes are to come for this channel!</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vox.com/worldly">Worldly (Vox)</a>*</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>The ideology behind the Toronto terror attack, explained (32 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  This channel was a new discovery for me in an attempt to find some other news-related podcasts to keep updated on current events. It was pretty good but I think for now I'll stick to NPR Up First and NYT's The Daily. The content of the podcast was very enlightening and opened my eyes to a subculture I'd never heard of.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/couples-therapy-with-candice-and-casey/id1380252026?mt=2">Couples Therapy with Candice and Casey</a>*</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Our First Podcast (32 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  Candice and Casey Neistat's inaugural podcast was a blast. I love getting a chance to hear Candice more compared to Casey's YouTube channel and also learn more about how they work through their arguments. Candice is a huge proponent of mental health and regularly going to a therapist for mental health maintenance and think that's so important that she uses this platform to change the conversation.</p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Don't Touch Me (40 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  Podcast #2 came out in time for the flight back home. This one talked a lot about vulnerability and physical touch with family members and friends. Really interesting conversation that will make you think more about your own relationships and saying "I love you" to your parents. Highly recommend this channel overall!</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amianahole.podbean.com/">Am I an A**hole</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>For Not Wanting Kids (1 hr 6 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  I recently discovered this podcast and thought it was such a refreshing format. They take on some questions that we think but may be hesitant to unpack. This one was about being a woman of childbearing age, or close to reaching the end of that time, and not wanting to have kids. It spoke a lot to my current stage in life and it helped me feel like I wasn't alone.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://hesaidwhatshow.com/">He Said What</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Meet Our Full Time Sugar Baby from SeekingArrangements.com (34 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  He Said What is one of the channels I started listening to as part of a collective of sex-positive podcasts I'm subscribing to. I want to be more open-minded with sex and think of it as less taboo that I grew up considering it. This episode I learned about a whole different lifestyle and career that I knew nothing about and was really interesting and enlightening.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://soundcloud.com/karenkazlucas">The spread podcast</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>MASTURBATION (42 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  This podcast is another channel that is helping me de-taboo sex. The hosts are two amazing women that talk about sex as if it's part of normal conversation (as it should). They don't hesitate and they are very open with their own experiences with feeling that sex is something to hide. This episode was all about masturbation, its myths, and ways to teach your kids about healthy masturbation. I love this podcast.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/dear-sugars">Dear Sugars</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Emotional Labor: The Invisible Work (Most) Women Do--With Gemma Hartly (46 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  Oh Dear Sugars, this is an amazing podcast. It's been around for a really long time but I subscribed to them just last month. They go through so many deep discussions from those who write in their relationship trials and tribulations. This specific episode was of women who are bearing emotional labor with their significant others and unsure how to proceed. The stories struck so close to home and what I believe many women will feel. I'm happy to not have the unbearable situations I had in the past, but in many relationships I have both personal and professionally I still have to set boundaries of emotional labor very deliberately.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/still-processing">Still Processing</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>We Watch Whiteness (1 hr 2 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  One of my favorite podcast channels of all time. The conversations between hosts unpack things I never was aware of and help me learn so much. At the very least, I learn a lot of the language to use when discussing these topics with others.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://soundcloud.com/ladies-who-lunch">Ladies Who Lunch</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>When Courage Meets Compassion (52 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  I love this podcast. The conversations between Ingrid Nilsen and Cat Valdes are so raw but eloquently stated that sometimes I take notes because they're able to put deep feelings into beautiful words.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/podcast/">The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>#113: Candice Kumai - The Japanese Art of Nourishing Mind, Body, & Spirit (1 hr 10 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  This rating was hard for me because I LOVE <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://candicekumai.com/">Candice Kumai</a> and I bought her new book, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kintsugi-Wellness-Japanese-Nourishing-Spirit/dp/0062669850">Kintsungi Wellness</a> that she is on "podcast tour" for, but the channel itself I'm not the biggest fan of its format. It starts with a lot of ads and ends with a lot of ads so it's hard to find the meat of what I wanted to listen to - which was Candice. Now, once you get to Candice's part I thought she was absolutely amazing. I would still recommend to listen but a heads up it starts 17 minutes in.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/the-bleed">Call Your Girlfriend</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Hey Ladies (54 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  Call Your Girlfriend was a random find perusing iTunes and I'm so happy I found it. A lot of their podcasts will end up on my future favorites lists, but this wasn't one of them only because I'm not that excited about the book it was promoting, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hey-Ladies-Story-Friends-Emails/dp/1419729136">Hey Ladies</a>. I think just because it doesn't resonate with my stage in life not because I think it will be a bad book. No hard feelings, not my cup of tea. Stay tuned for more episodes I've loved from CYG.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/podcasts">Stuff Mom Never Told You</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Are NFL Cheerleaders Being Exploited? (58 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  I've been following SMNTY for a bit now and have lots of favorites. This one wasn't one of them, but I still thought it was really interesting. It was an appropriate topic to cover but I just thought it was more discussion opinion-based vs. interview-based.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily">The Daily</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>A Life-or-Death Crisis for Black Mothers (26 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  This episode is so important for everyone to listen to. It discusses the implicit and explicit bias of medical care for black women, especially for pregnancy care and pain control. It's scary and incredibly sad but being aware of it helps us actively make changes to move forward.</p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>Return of Rudy Guiliani (22 in): ✔︎✔︎</b>  Eh, this was ok. Only because of the topic. I think I dozed off in the middle of this one anyway.</p>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://letstalkaboutitwithtaylornolan.libsyn.com/">Let's Talk About It With Taylor Nolan</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">➢<b>EP23: Stereotypes of Masculinity (1 hr 12 min): ✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎</b>  I've been subscribed to Let's Talk About It for a few months now and I've never been disappointed. This one definitely spoke to my feminist heart because it addressed masculinity and how it is defined and challenged. I loved the conversation between the hosts and the guest. Highly recommend to listen to this one.</p>

	<p>As a 28-going-on-29-year-old woman, there are two things society puts a lot of pressure on having in my life: <b>marriage and kids</b>. From social media FOMO, living in a neighborhood surrounded by families, and most recently becoming a Tita (aunt, in the Philippines) it's really easy to feel that I am missing out on what I've been conditioned to think is an essential component of womanhood. In today's article, I unpack my [potentially problematic] thoughts on <b>not-a-motherhood</b>.</p>
	<p>Today's article is in tribute to all of the Mothers out there. You are inspirations to me and I immensely respect all that you do and are capable of. Being a Mother is not currently part of my identity, but I aim to support and lift Mothers in my life to achieve your dreams and go for the life you want. Motherhood is an honor that I may or may not have in my future. But this challenges me to continue pursuing my life in its current state for now.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>feeling of selfishness.</b></h4>
	<p>I recently listened to a podcast about unpacking the feeling of not wanting to have kids yet, and if that made you a bad person. The guest on the show talked about how she spent much of her 20's being the sole caretaker of her grandmother. She lived with her grandmother and spent all of her time ensuring her survival. And now the guest has shifted to live independently in her early 30's and isn't ready to raise a child. She is taking this moment to find herself again. This really spoke to my feelings because now that I'm in my first year of not being a student and not being in professional training at the age of 28, I'm finding myself again. This makes me feel selfish, but I try not to think of it this way and I wonder if it's because of all of the explicit and implicit external pressure.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>frustration with patriarchy.</b></h4>
	<p>Infrastructures in the United States of America don't support equality for families. Things like family leave packages (or lack thereof) make me worried whenever I am ready to start a family that I won't be able to raise the kid(s) with the equality that I feel is necessary for the next generation. I understand now that I've learned a lot about feminist history that we've come a long way, but recent political times make me worried that the pendulum may be swinging in a direction I cannot accept.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>fear of pregnancy.</b></h4>
	<p>Having seen two women in my life at the same time go through very different pregnancies with their own difficulties, I have to admit it puts fears in me for going through the same or worse. I also know a woman who went through a lot of health concerns with pre-eclampsia and being bedridden in the hospital for weeks. This is definitely only looking at the negative side of it but as a healthcare professional I get concerned. On the other hand, I also know a woman who had 5 children and was absolutely in love with pregnancy and raising children. What gives me hope is that all of these women have remained resilient and are thriving.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>being ready too late.</b></h4>
	<p>I have thoughts that maybe my readiness will happen after I'm able to have kids. Can I even have kids? I don't know. The imminent body clock doesn't help me believe my decision to have a child someday would be an organic one. Everyone says you never truly feel “ready”. Instead you do what you can to be prepared, set up infrastructure around you to support financially and even socially, then brace yourself. But I just don’t feel ready right now and I don’t know what it will feel like when I'm closer to ready.</p>
	<h4><b>the bottom line.</b></h4>
	<p>It is not lost on me that these thoughts are <b>highly privileged</b> potentially problematic. I'm fortunate to be in a place where I have the choice to decide when I have children. I have access to birth control and health insurance, a support system, and amazing women in my life as examples for me. Not everyone is this lucky. But I will keep fighting for these resources for all who want to start a family or control when it happens for them.</p>
	<p>I will also celebrate the Mothers in my life who are absolutely rock stars as well as their partners who parent alongside them. I believe that parenting requires equality but also support that a bond between a Mother and child is a unique and special one. I know this because of the relationship I have with my own Mom who I love and admire very much.</p>

	<p>A few weeks ago she posted her video growing up as a Korean American and created a "Growing Up Asian American" Tag with set questions. It spoke so much to where I am now trying to bring the Asian part of my identity out from hibernation. Here are my responses to the tag!</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>1. Which ethnicity are you?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">Filipina. Both of my parents were born and raised in the Philippines.</p>
	<p><b>2. Which generation are you?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">First generation. I was born in Puerto Rico (fact: this makes me a US citizen) after my parents moved there for my dad's PhD program.</p>
	<p><b>3. What is the first experience where you felt that demarcation of being a minority/different?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">I honestly don't remember the exact moment that I realized I was a minority/different. But I do remember being asked in elementary school if I was Chinese, Vietnamese, and many other nationalities. It was a rare thing when I was that young that they would guess the Philippines until I got older, and that usually was because they knew someone of the same ethnicity (this was always the follow-up comment).</p>
	<p className="tabbed">But I would say I noticed I was different mostly when I would look at pictures with my friends growing up. This may sound silly, but I would always "forget" about my skin color until these points.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>[RELATED] <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2DCGp2p">"What Are You?" How I’ve Been Asked About My Ethnicity?</a></b></h4>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>4. Were you always proud of your heritage or was there a time you rejected it?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">I used to say things like "I don't see color" and I see now that was a form of rejection. I don't think that I would deliberately reject my heritage but I would also not actively continue it wherever I went. I don't really have any Filipino friends besides those I know from the community at home. I don't regularly cook Filipino food because I don't always get the ingredients sand it's usually not a quick fix meal.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>[RELATED] <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2r7hlxE">Being "Not That" Asian</a></b></h4>
		<br></br>
	<p><b>5. What are some stereotypes that you struggle with?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">As a whole, I don't think that the Philippines has as many stereotypes to "struggle" with. I mostly get people who are excited to guess my ethnicity correctly and then want to talk about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpia">lumpia</a>. Don't get me wrong, I love connect to people through food but that tends to be the pattern.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">I will say that I generally get lumped into the overall Asian model minority stereotype. I have the benefit of people assuming I'm naturally smart, but then don't give credit to the fact that I really just have to work hard and my parents instilled discipline with my ambition.</p>
	<p><b>6. Can you speak your language?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">No, and now that I'm older I wish that I did. My parents didn't speak to us in Tagalog, then national language in the Philippines. They told my sister and I that it's because they learned Tagalog alongside English at the same time in school. Their native tongue is actually their dialects and they both speak different ones. So since we were in the US, they used English with us.</p>
	<p><b>7. How has being Asian American affected your relationship with your parents?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">Being the oldest child, I had a lot of occasions that the parenting styles of my friends mismatched my own parents. This affected me in the way that I felt comfortable asking for permission to go to friend's houses, dating, etc. Now that I'm older my parents have had a lot more experience and time evolving their identities to include more culture here in the USA.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">I wouldn't say my relationship has been strained at all about my being Asian American. They seem pretty open-minded to my goals and values and mostly hope that I continue preserving the culture within our US family.</p>
	<p><b>8. How do you feel about your heritage now? Do you identify with it?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">I came to the realization recently that because my boyfriend is Caucasian, if we were to have children I would have to be very deliberate in maintaining Filipino culture. As I grow in my personal empowerment, I've been diving more deeply into my identity and heritage. I no longer thing in terms of "not seeing color" but rather seek to embrace this part of my identity. I am learning how much of my heritage has been hibernating since I left home and am not surrounded by Filipinos all the time like I was growing up.</p>
	<p><b>9. What is your favorite thing about being Asian American/your heritage?</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">Identity and on a fun note, food! I love how food brings people together, and brings a sense of community. I love sharing my favorite dishes and seeing what others may enjoy and create memories.</p>

		<p>1. Run a 5K in Manhattan - <b>COMPLETE!</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I proudly completed my first 5K without stopping to walk back in March, and have already signed up for my second race in June! My time for the 5K was 34:56 minutes at a 10:31 minute/mile pace. The race felt great, like I could have run faster, but my goal was to finish without walking and I'm really proud of myself for it. How I felt running during the race was proof that the training paid off. My race in July is for a 4-miler, and this will be the longest I've run since the 5K!</p>
		<p>2. Travel out of the country twice - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I will be going to Barcelona in May! In fact, today May 7th I am currently here! I can't wait to share the experience with you all. As far as the second international trip, that's still being planned out but it will hopefully be during December.</p>
		<p>3. Participate in a protest/march - <b>COMPLETE!</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed"> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2FVnQr0">Women's March</a>. 'Nuff said. ✓</p>
		<p className="tabbed">[RELATED] <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2FVnQr0">Everything You Need To Know About The 2018 Women's March</a></b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">In April, I also witnessed the March for Our Lives. I didn't walk in it, but instead made efforts to amplify the voices of those marching. I was live-tweeting protest signs and listened to the program at the start of the march. It was incredibly inspiring to hear stories of survivors and see how intersectional the protest truly was.</p>

		<p>4. Submit 10 essays/articles for websites - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I've made no progress on this one so far. I continue to have a list of websites to contribute to. Back in February I switched this from "in progress" to "not started" since I am only to the point of listing out potential opportunities. Since my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2vlqo0d">first quarter reflection</a>, I still want to keep this on but perhaps pursue it differently. More to come.</p>
		<p>5. Take a creative writing course - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Still not progress for this. Some options I could pursue are Lynda.com or even Coursera. Do you any of you readers have suggestions?</p>
		<p>6. Learn how to curl hair with a curler - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I'm officially changing this to "in progress" for this month. While I haven't purchased a curler, I have been able to use my straightener again to get used to doing my hair. I also stopped straightening or blowdrying for the past month and embracing the waves. I found that a lot of my resistance to curling was simply not being used to seeing my hair with more volume. But I'm learning about a whole new group of hair products I've never used before.</p>
		<p>7. Pay more rent than student loan bill each month - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Completed this one so far every month! Last month I actually got a bonus at work and dedicated a large portion of that to an even higher loan payment. Eight more months to go… (and many more years).</p>
		<p>8. Wear more lipstick - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I actually dipped down in my lipstick use in April. My morale was lower than usual given the weather and I just wasn't feeling it. But it looks like Spring is FINALLY coming to New York City which means my life will be full of color again. </p>
		<p className="tabbed">[RELATED] <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2DdLdOM">Power of the Red Lip</a></b></p>

		<p className="tabbed">I've now finished 3 products so far! If you're interested in me writing a post about what my 18 products are, leave me a comment below!</p>
		<p>10. Explore all of the New York City boroughs - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I mentioned back in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2p7iIJh">February update</a> that I hoped to explore Queens after the 5K in Roosevelt Island in March. That didn't happen. However, I am officially switching this to "in progress" because I explored Brooklyn multiple times now! I went to Williamsburg to see an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2uF0lkb">event hosted by Emma Gray</a> promoting her book (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amzn.to/2JOyJf7">A Girl's Guide to Joining the Resistance</a>), went to DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) for an event at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.the-wing.com/">The Wing</a> location there, and finally to Prospect Park for my boyfriend's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.brooklyn15k.com/">15K race</a>! Brooklyn is pretty great and I understand why so many people are wanting to live there. Two boroughs down!</p>

		<p className="tabbed">April was an exciting month to rejuvenate this goal.

Part of my agency has been asking for the things I want and need. For my introversion and wellness, that's <b>solitude</b>.</p>
	<p>I know what my needs are but communicating them is a whole different ballgame. At first, expressing my needs was <b>really uncomfortable</b>. I felt guilty for asking. I felt afraid to hear no. I felt like I would be judged. I felt a lot of negative things. And it didn't go away at first, But over time, in conjunction with owning my needs more and more, I was able to come to peace with it.</p>

		<br></br>
	<p>One of the big things I wanted to get better at was saying no to social engagements. There's a lot of pressure that comes with an introvert trying to live in a world that celebrates extrovert activities. After work happy hour, after-parties, co-working office spaces, BBQ's, weekend beach retreats, and so much more.</p>
	<p>In residency, there were a lot of scheduled bonding activities. I was really glad they happened because it helped us get to know each other outside of the rigorous work environment. But the immediately afterwards I was drained. I needed at least a day of doing nothing for recovery but that kind of time is nonexistent during residency. As a result, my energy suffered and my work suffered. It made me stronger, but I wasn't happy.</p>
	<p>Being in a large residency group, there were a lot of un-official bonding activities too. Some of the leaders of the group would organize a lot of different events for whoever would make it. I rarely made it out, and I felt punished for it in different ways (mostly self-imposed). I felt like everyone thought I didn't want to be part of the group, that I was a spoil-sport, or even felt above it all. But the reality was I was barely keeping up with the energy needed to get through a work day and my time out of the hospital was much-needed solitude.</p>
	<p>I knew something needed to change otherwise I would keep falling into the vicious circle of guilt and exhaustion. It took baby steps but I finally built the confidence and my environment was accepting. Here are 6 things that happened when I stopped apologizing for needing solitude.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
		<br></br>
	<p>1. <b>People came to expect it.</b> I was with a group of co-workers at my new job when they were planning weekly happy hours, and I said upfront that I probably wouldn't be attending many of them because I was an introvert and it wears me out. I don't remember exactly what I said, but that was the gist. I was first met with the usual disbelief because I didn't seem shy (more on that later), but afterwards I didn't feel guilty at not attending some invitations. I was met with understanding and didn't require explanation when I stated I would be staying in that night. I asked those who attended how the events went afterwards, and this was the new normal.</p>
	<p>2. <b>People accommodated to my needs.</b> Introverts don't hate people. In fact, I love people but I prefer interacting with them in a smaller group. Before I was comfortable saying no to outings, I would also pair it with an offer to do lunch or coffee instead. My friends started offering other ways to hang out and invited me to outings but didn't force it if I said I wasn't feeling it that night.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Others admit they have similar needs.</b> There are many situations where a group goes with the idea of whoever made the first suggestion, assuming consensus automatically. Once I started feeling comfortable stating my preference and being the one to propose the alternative option, more people felt comfortable expressing similar feelings. They would start to offer other suggestions, or state they didn't want to do the activity either and thank me. This sounds very adversary but it's not meant to be. It's mainly to emphasize that expressing your ideas empowers others to express theirs.</p>
	<p>4. <b>I felt more rested and focused at work.</b> Because I'm wearing myself out the night before at a group event and staying up extra late afterwards to wind down, I am more rested at work. 'Nuff said.</p>
	<p>5. <b>I feel empowered to express my needs in other things.</b> It feels good to express what I need and not be met with animosity or guilt. The more that I surrounding myself with people who respect it, the more I kept doing it. Now that I'm used to doing it with people I know, I actually am more comfortable doing it upfront with anyone I meet.</p>
	<p>6. <b>I feel happier and more fulfilled.</b> At the end of the day, it's all about getting what you need out of life to go for what you want. When you get through the uncomfortable time period of <b>asking</b>, you release a lot of negative energy into the ether and make room for the things that make you happy.</p>
	<p>By sharing my experiences I hope to empower you to go on your own journey too. Have you had similar feelings about expressing your needs? What happened after you tried it? Share in the comments below.</p>

	<p>There's nothing like reuniting with family, especially with the next generation of our family. I hadn't seen my nephew since December when he was born and was able to reunite this month - 4 months later! He was baptized into the Catholic faith and I am honored to be one of his Godmothers ("Ninang" in Tagalog). I extended my visit a couple of days to be able to babysit and have time with him to myself. It was such a great time.</p>

And it's mostly because it's intimidating to me but also because I was trying to figure out what the voice would be on that platform. But I also discovered so many YouTube channels that I'm definitely behind the bandwagon on but have empowered me to believe that I do in fact have a story to tell, and that I should just go for it. Some of my newly discovered favorites include: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">Casey Neistat</a> (I know, I'm behind), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/petermckinnon24">Peter McKinnon</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/saradietschy">Sara Dietschy</a> (rhymes with peachy), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rowenatsai">Rowena Tsai</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial">Amy Landino</a>,and so many more.</p>

I can't wait to see what this means for the future of Coffee Meets Polished. But it also will make for some pretty awesome vlogging and photo opportunities when going to Barcelona.

But as I followed through its social media I quickly came to realize how much it aligns with my female empowerment journey. At its foundation it is a co-working space for women. But if you ever step foot into the space and look behind it's aesthetically pleasing interior design, you see how important it is that a space like this exists. It is a space FOUNDED BY women, FOR women, DESIGNED BY women. And every in of the space you realize this. While I am enamored with all of the beauty and skin care products available and comfortable couches, feminist café dishes and cocktails; I'm also in love with the free feminine products in the bathroom, and pumping room for mothers. In addition to the space, it has events hosted in all of its locations that I signed up for and attended for the first time this month. I've already gone to so many events and so many scheduled, that it will need its own post - stay tuned.</p>

	<p>Today's article comes at the specific request from one of the Coffee Meets Polished subscribers who recently found out she matched to a pharmacy residency program! The "Match" was in March and it was a great day for many to find out where you will be for the next one to two years. In the pharmacy training world, there are multiple paths to take after graduating. These include going straight to work, fellowship, and one or two years of residency. For those pursuing residency, it is a way to specialize and it's said that one year of residency equates to approximately three years of on-the-job experience.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>[RELATED] <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2DGQ4nX">10 Tips for Orienting Yourself to a New Job</a></h4>
		<br></br>
	<p>I've written a lot about residency, and in fact it is a large part of the reason I wanted to launch Coffee Meets Polished. Some of the toughest times I've had mentally and emotionally were in residency but I can honestly say I came out the other side more empowered than I have in my life.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>[RELATED] <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2rDbjoN">The 5 Toughest Mental Health Lessons from Residency</a></h4>
		<br></br>
	<p>While it's an exciting time to have a fresh start, it's also intimidating especially with the daunting reputation of residency training. Pharmacy school is four years of post-college coursework with the final year being direct patient care experiences. But school can only prepare you for so much once your license is on the line.</p>
	<p>But don't fret! Today I'm sharing the most important things to remember during your transition period, which I consider Match Day to your first day of residency orientation. These tips don't just apply to preparing for residency but can also apply to any transition.</p>
	<p>1. <b>Finish strong.</b> It's so tempting after you find out your post-graduate plans to completely check out. And to some extent, it's okay. After all, you got your goal! No need to impress anyone anymore, right? The trick is: you still have to graduate. You also don't want to burn any potential bridges by "slacking off" at the end. Remember that first impressions AND last impressions are extremely important.</p>
	<p>2. <b>Take a trip.</b> Leave, and don't look back. A lot of people will schedule a trip away, and I highly recommend it. For me, my trip was going home for a month. As an introvert, this is what I needed (I also wanted to save money). Going on a trip is a way to celebrate your awesome accomplishment and also disconnect from pharmacy for a bit. By disconnecting, you're able to close that chapter mentally in order to make room in your mind for the next step when orientation arrives.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Don't get out of bed until noon.</b> I can't express enough how important it is to rest. You'll have adrenaline after getting into residency and graduating, but you must still rest. Do nothing. Don't get out of bed until noon (I didn't for a week after arriving home). Re-unite with your loved ones. Rest. This combined with a trip is part of the cleansing process of your mind, and recovery from the rigors of pharmacy school. </p>
	<p>4. <b>Think about everything except residency.</b> Can you detect a pattern here? Take a trip, rest, and do things you enjoy. Find where you're going to live. Figure out how and when you're going to move. Go back to your happiness roots and connect back with the hobbies you may have put on hold during pharmacy school. If you were able to hold on to it all while in school, then I admire you. If not, heed this advice and find yourself again. </p>
		<br></br>
	<h4>[RELATED] <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2njBbRl">Futile Pursuit of Balance: Set Boundaries Instead</a></h4>
		<br></br>
	<p>5. <b>Connect with your new co-residents.</b> You don't have to do this right away, but I'm sure a group text will be in the near future. If you're going to residency where you went to pharmacy school, be one of the leaders to start the conversation. It's helpful to get to know your co-residents especially when it comes to finding housing, roommates, and getting into some social habits before residency gets hard. For my cohort, we had BBQ's at apartments and went to some local bars. A GroupMe was created with everyone and it ended up being the main form of communication between us besides email listservs. The group texts continue to live on even today!</p>
	<p>6. <b>Pass your boards.</b> This is related to finishing strong, but if you don't pass your boards then you can't practice as a resident, or a pharmacist for that matter. A lot of people will ask me when they should take their MPJE (law) and NAPLEX between graduating pharmacy school and starting residency, and I'm not sure there's a single best way. The first thing I would find out is when your residency program requires you to complete your licensures. For some this is not until a couple months after your first day, and some require upon starting.</p>
	<p className="tabbed"><b>Pro tip #1:</b> Even if your program doesn't require until later in the orientation period, your learning experience is INFINITELY better as early as possible.</p>
	<p className="tabbed"><b>Pro tip #2:</b> You can take the licensing exams anywhere there is a testing site.</p>
	<p>For me, I needed to be licensed in North Carolina but was spending a lot of time at home in Florida after graduating, so I took the exam in Florida. I took my law exam just a few weeks after graduating for a few reasons. For one, in case I didn't pass I would have enough time to try again (there's a waiting period) before starting residency. Also, I knew that was the harder one for most people and wanted to get it over with. I didn't take the NAPLEX until after orientation for residency started. This was actually quite helpful because I had my co-residents to share their experiences with me and they also shared some of their study materials. Also, having been in orientation I was able to dust off the clinical cobwebs as I was training to get my brain back in gear.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>TL;DR?</b> Pass your boards, rest, and don't think about residency. You'll be forced to think about it more than you want to soon enough.</h4>
		<br></br>
	<p>In all seriousness, you should be proud of how far you've come. Residency will be tough. If it wasn't, then anyone could do it. But you worked hard, applied, interviewed, matched. The next stage will test you to show up, and keep showing up. You will build relationships with your co-residents, pharmacy staff, and preceptors that will last a lifetime. And you will be a better health care professional for your team and most importantly: patients.</p>

It's been great to hold myself accountable by sharing the progress with you all. Along with monthly check-ins, it's important to have period reflections to take a step back and reflect on the big picture. I like to do this every quarter of whatever time period is allotted for any goal. The end of March was also the end of quarter one, and here are my thoughts on how it went.</p>
		<br></br>

		<br></br>
	<p>1. <b>How do I keep a goal going I've already accomplished?</b></p>
	<p>In March, I completed a 5K run. CHECK!  I got a lot more fit than I probably ever have, but what next? I’ve run once since then and was in a really good place and motivated to keep going, but I’m in a drought. How do we keep continuously improving after a goal is accomplished that should be incorporated into every day wellbeing?</p>

	<p>2. <b>I need help.</b></p>
	<p>Sometimes you need to build a team to get what you need accomplished. I got some help with organization and management of the marketing side of Coffee Meets Polished and while we are still in the workflow-building phase, I'm excited for how much this will increase my capacity and help me focus on content creation.</p>
		<br></br>
	<p>3. <b>Does this goal still align with my personal strategic plan?</b></p>
	<p>Not every goal needs to continue. I haven’t gotten to the point where I plan to cut any out, but for a quarterly reflection I want to bring up that point.</p>
		<br></br>
	<p>4. <b>It's a marathon, not a sprint.</b></p>
	<p>There are a few of my goals that haven't gotten any traction and that is okay. Not every goal needs to be going at the same time. To continue long-term motivation, we must focus on the small wins to propel us to the next small win and these will snowball to the larger wins. If we have all goals going at the same time and going one inch at a time, you will burn out. But if you direct a larger piece of the energy pie to one that you can get done over a pre-defined period (you define it!) you will have more capacity to move on to the next goal.</p>
		<br></br>
	<p>5. <b>Face your stalls.</b></p>
	<p>Keep yourself accountable. It’s easy to think of reasons outside yourself that a goal may not be met or progressing well enough. Take my subscriber count for example. I had a huge rate of increase in the first couple of months but it has slowed down quite a bit. But I know the reasons why, I haven’t been consistent. And that’s okay. To have the breakthrough, you need to have a breakdown. While I am not at breakdown point I did re-group and decide to get some help (see point #2).</p>

	<p>It's my hope that by sharing these reflections it empowers you to reflect on your own. Going into the two middle quarters of the year can make it hard to find motivation and puts us at the highest risk of letting go of our goals before picking it back up towards the end. But by doing these reflections so we are able to take a step back to see the bigger picture and we realize how far we've actually come. In the life principle of <b>continuous improvement</b>, always remember that it's the journey that matters most.</p>

	<p>Last year I tried a lot great new makeup and skincare brands with products that have become some of my holy grails. One of my goals for the year was to use up products more than purchasing them, but it doesn't mean that I can't replace products once I'm done with them. I am actually proud to say that I've not purchased ANY makeup or skincare products so far in 2018. And I have 4 products I've used up!</p>
	<p>But now there's a Sephora VIB Sale and there's a list of products on my wish list… It's during this time I think about treating myself with an item (or six?).</p>
	<p>Before I get started on my wish list, here are the details of the sale:</p>
	<p><b>VIB ROUGE DATES:</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">APRIL 13TH - APRIL 16TH AND APRIL 20th - APRIL 23rd: 15% Off <span>➡</span>️use code: YAYROUGE (April 13th for one day you can bring a friend and extend your rouge discount)</p>
	<p><b>VIB DATES:</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">APRIL 20th - APRIL 23rd: 15% Off <span>➡</span>use code: YAYVIB</p>
	<p><b>BeautyInsider DATES:</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">APRIL 20th - APRIL 23rd: 10% Off <span>➡</span>use code: YAYINSIDER</p>
	<p>The products on my wish list for the Sephora sale are divided into makeup, skin care, and hair care. Have you used any of these products below? If so, please share with me any of your thoughts in the comment section!</p>
	<h4><b>makeup.</b></h4>
	<p>I'm pretty happy with the makeup products I have now. When I moved from North Carolina to New York City last summer, I did a huge de-clutter knowing that I wouldn't have much space to house a big collection. The process required me to only keep products that I truly enjoyed and use. That being said, I always am up for a fun new lip color, and need to replace high-use products (foundation, mascara, brow pencils, etc.) every few months.</p>
	<p>The two brands I want to try products from for this sale are Fenty and It Cosmetics. I'm definitely behind the wagon for both of these, but one product is for fun and the other is for a test run replacement for a high-use product. Can you guess which is which category?</p>

	<h4><b>skin care.</b></h4>
	<p>I spent a lot of effort learning about my skincare needs over the past year and it has strengthened my self-awareness and self-love. I've learned to embrace my skin and appreciate the mindfulness of my skin care routine. Right now I've got some great products for my needs but there are some things I can use to enhance even more.</p>
	<p>One product is curated by Glow Recipe, a company that I love! I gifted my mom the Blithe Chaga Serum for Christmas and got really intrigued to try a pressed serum as part of my regimen. I've also heard great things about the Laneige Lip Mask. It looks like a amazing things and that it lasts forever (and therefore a good value). I keep Vaseline on the side of my bed to put on my lips each night, but I'm always up for trying something new and may have some other hydrating properties.</p>

	<p>I've evolved from focusing on makeup, then skin care, and this year I really want to focus on my hair routine. I have very dry, flaky scalp and hair that is partially wavy and thick. I've always just either straightened it or put it in a ponytail, but one of my goals was to learn how to use a hair curler. But before I figure out how to style in this way, I really want to get down what my hair care regimen is.</p>
	<p>These two products are ones that I've heard really great things about and are high priority on my wish list.</p>

At some point in every woman’s life, she will face sexism somewhere - in a relationship, in a workplace, walking down the street. We are all part of social systems or environments where women face hostility and oppression because they’re women in a man's world. Navigating sexism can be difficult, but there's another level added when it's coming from the people closest to you. The only way we’re going to change anti-woman culture is if we have each other’s backs."</p>

	<h4><b>international women's day.</b></h4>
	<p>Every year, March 8th is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/">International Women's Day</a>. Some would argue that should be every day and ask why we need a dedicated day of the year for us. But until society sees women as equal to men and masculinity is re-defined for true feminism to exist, I will support this day. My first IWD in New York City was pretty awesome! I got to attend an event at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.uospaces.com/ninety8/williamsburg-ny">Space Ninety 8</a> celebrating the launch of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/emma-gray">HuffPost Senior Reporter</a> and Co-Host of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://soundcloud.com/here-to-make-friends">Here to Make Friends Podcast</a> Emma Gray's new book: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Girls-Guide-Joining-Resistance-Feminist/dp/0062748084/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag">A Girl's Guide to Joining the Resistance: A Feminist Handbook on Fighting for Good</a>. The event was so empowering and the book is great. I also loved getting to meet her panelists, including Liz Plank! You can find tons of  pictures from the event on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.uospaces.com/ninety8/en/williamsburg-ny/blog/posts/uo-happenings-international-womens-day-celebration">Space Ninety 8 site</a>. </p>

	<h4><b>personal records.</b></h4>
	<p>One of my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2mCwVg9">19 Before 2019</a> goals was to run a 5K. I started training in January without any 5K registration by starting with the goal of 1 mile per week. That quickly escalated in February (thank you NYC walking) and my boyfriend found a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tristateruns.com/nycstpaddys7k">5K in Roosevelt Island</a>! Thanks to great training I was able to stick to a running plan and accomplish my goal of finishing without walking for the first time in my life! I was really proud of myself and continue to try and run 1-2 times per week to remind myself that I still can. </p>

	<h4><b>march for our lives.</b></h4>
	<p>On March 24th, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://marchforourlives.com/">March for Our Lives</a> in New York City started right around the corner from my house, just like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2FVnQr0">Women's March</a> in January. This time, I stood in the sidewalks cheering on protesters and sharing their signs on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2Go3xlx">Coffee Meets Polished Twitter</a>. I'm so grateful to live where I can participate in and amplify voices of these activist movements.</p>

	<h4><b>winter microadventures.</b></h4>
	<p>This month was filled with tons of firsts, including my first time skiing! I went to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.windhammountain.com/">Windham Mountain</a> and it was an amazing experience. I was a master of the bunny slopes by the end of the day, and I can't wait to try skiing again next year. </p>

	<h4><b>winter's last ditch effort.</b></h4>
	<p>The first day of Spring was March 20th, but New York City didn't get the message and gave us a big snow that rivaled the first snow of the season. It was fluffy and perfect for making snow-women and sledding in Central Park. While the snow was beautiful, I can't wait for the weather to warm up and flowers to come out.</p>

	<p>This weekend I went skiing for the first time, and it was not as easy as I thought it would be. I thought I would be able to rock the skis quickly but I was so new that I needed instruction on how to put my boot into the skis. However, thanks to some great instructors at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2GuiUt7">Windham Mountain</a> I was rocking the bunny slopes by the end of the day.</p>
	<img src="/images/windhammountainmap.jpg" alt="Windham Mountain Map" />
	<p>I learned a lot of tips and tricks to get going on skis. I also realized there are a lot of life lessons that apply to the whole experience.</p>
	<img src="/images/windhammountainexperience.jpg" alt="Windham Mountain Experience" />
	<p>1. <b>You have to walk before you can run.</b> Or in my case, learn how to put skis on before the bunny runs. If it's your first time skiing, take a lesson.</p>
	<p>2. <b>Master the fundamentals before incorporating short cuts.</b> I was given a set of poles to use immediately which I used to balance but also move around. I saw a lot of other beginners without poles in order to master their legs first and wished I had done that. Incorporating the poles caused me to feel less comfortable balancing with just my legs.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Invest in good tools.</b> Tools help you do your best work. I learned that rental boots aren't something I want to use again. They were painful and bruised me, but it's also probably because my jeans were digging into my foot and the boots were so tight. Bottom line is, invest in good tools to get the job done.</p>
	<img src="/images/windhammountainskis.jpg" alt="Windham Mountain Skis" />
	<p>4. <b>Be ready.</b> The end of the ski lift will come whether you're ready or not. Make sure you're ready.</p>
	<p>5. <b>Don't apologize for falling.</b> The first time I got off a lift, I had my first fall 2 seconds later. I looked at the sky and thought, "How do I get back up?" My boyfriend was there with me and I was determined to figure out how to get up by myself. But I wasn't able to. I kept apologizing for not being able to and slowing us down from going down the bunny slope. Thinking back, why was I apologizing? Falling is part of the process.</p>
	<p>6. <b>After you fall, get right back up.</b> With help, I got back up from falling right after getting off the ski lift. The rest of my first bunny slope run was bad. I was afraid of the speed (upon looking at video footage, I was barely moving) and I couldn't stop. I tried the strategy with roller skating where you lightly run into the wall to stop. However, with skiing that doesn't really exist. Instead, I turned into another run and went into the side of a wall of snow. And once I officially reached 0 mph I shuffled to my boyfriend and said, "I'm not ready for this." Instead of taking me back to the training ground, he said, "We're doing it again. You are ready." And with that second run and the rest thereafter, I focused on incremental improvements each time. </p>
	<img src="/images/windhammountainlift.jpg" alt="Windham Mountain Lift" />
	<p>7. <b>Embrace your support system.</b> See #6. If it wasn't for my support in helping me get back up after falling, and taking me back to the lift right away I likely wouldn't have gone skiing for the rest of the day, or ever again.</p>
	<p>8. <b>Learn from the younger generation.</b> Hanging out in the training grounds and bunny slopes was such a humbling experience. Not just because of my lack of skills, but because there were 3-5 year olds who were masters at skiing. Watching them be fearless, fall, get back up (without poles!), and have fun all along the way was inspiring. These little humans could be the next Olympians! I tried to apply their fearless attitude to myself and all of my adult self-doubt.</p>
	<p>9. <b>Don't compare yourself to others.</b> It's easy to get caught up in seeing all of the other skiers go effortlessly down the slopes and think, "I'll never be able to do that." Whether that is true or not, it is not productive to think this way. Remember that if it's your first time, everyone has been where you are at some point. Focus on your goals and your improvement at your own pace.</p>
	<p>10.  <b>Don't take yourself too seriously.</b> Some things are supposed to be fun! Let them be fun, and stay fun.</p>
	<img src="/images/windhammountainfun.jpg" alt="Windham Mountain Fun" />
	<p>My first skiing experience was filled with self-doubt, stress, and pain at times but it was also filled with sense of accomplishment and confidence that the next time I strap on some skis I'll be able to keep growing from where I ended that day.</p>
	<p>Thank you to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2GuiUt7">Windham Mountain</a> for the great experience and service overall! I can't wait to go back.</p>

		<p className="tabbed">I didn't pursue some of my ideas this month. I was hoping to do a "self love" challenge in February but clearly that didn't pan out. I have more ideas for later months and hope to have one planned out far enough in advance.</p>
		<p>19. Do a giveaway and/or collaboration - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I honestly haven't gotten the guts yet to reach out for a collaboration. But I'm hoping once I reach some of my follower milestones that I'll do a giveaway. I'm excited to keep growing and expanding with other content creators!</p>
		<p>Each month it's important to celebrate your progress and not get bogged down with how many more "in progress" and "not started" there are compared to "complete". Focus on <b>continuous improvement</b>. Our job is rarely completely finished, especially when it comes to our personal growth.</p>

	<h4><b>teenage empowerment.</b></h4>
	<p>I love when the younger generations are portrayed in a positive light. Being a Millenial, I can relate to being misunderstood or inappropriately labeled. The teenagers and teachers who survived the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/us/stoneman-douglas-parkland-shooting.html">Parkland School shooting</a> are heroes and agents for change. They channeled their energy into making the world better than the one that allowed their experience to happen.

	<h4><b>black panther.</b></h4>
	<p>I watched this on opening weekend, and I don't remember the last time I did that (thank you, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2HVpzNJ">Movie Pass</a>)! It was such an amazing experience to watch, and I felt very similarly to how I felt watching Wonder Woman. I felt this sense of importance of the movie, thinking of what kind of impact it has for African Americans and how they are represented in the media. If you haven't seen it yet, you must. There's a reason it's breaking records.</p>
		<br></br>
	<h4><b>winter olympics.</b></h4>
	<p>Of course this is a favorite! I loved watching curling, alpine events, halfpipe, speed skating, and bob sled. I didn't watch as much figure skating since it played so late, but I did get to watch the female Russians compete for gold and silver and my jaw dropped. The coverage of the Olympics highlighted a lot of diversity of gender and race which was exciting to see. </p>

	<h4><b>milk and honey.</b></h4>
	<p>I've had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.bookculture.com/book/9781449474256">Milk and Honey</a> by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/rupikaur_/?hl=en">Rupi Kaur</a> on my hold list for eBooks at the New York Public Library for months and months, and I finally got it! I had to force myself to take my time and reflect on each page. There were passages that took my breath away. Her ability to portray emotions into words on a page just amazes me. If you haven't read it yet, you must. I am considering purchasing the book for re-reading. On deck is her second book, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.bookculture.com/book/9781449486792">The Sun and Her Flowers.</a> </p>

	<h4><b>love.</b></h4>
	<p>February isn't the only month for love, but it's highlighted enough that it causes you to reflect on it. I feel grateful that I grew up in a home filled with love, and now that I'm independent I work towards self-love and mutual love with my boyfriend as we build a new home. Love is such an essential part of our human lives; it's important to nurture it and not take it for granted.</p>

	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://katebowler.com/everything-happens/">Everything Happens, with Kate Bowler</a></b>: "Life isn’t always bright and shiny, as Kate Bowler knows. Kate is a young mother, writer and professor who, at age 35, was suddenly diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. In, warm, insightful, often funny conversations, Kate talks with people about what they’ve learned in dark times. Kate teaches at Duke Divinity School and is author of 'Everything Happens (And Other Lies I've Loved).'"</p>
	<p>My favorite podcast so far was the first one I listened to, <b>Costly Love</b>. While in pharmacy residency, one of the readings we had was "When Breath Becomes Air". We had discussions around creating boundaries of empathy with our patients in order to do our professional service for them. It is an incredibly powerful book that made everyone who read it cry. The podcast features the author's husband and she talks about the publishing process, and the cost of loving as deeply as you can with the time you have - and moving forward after loss.</p>

Thanks to social media platforms, it’s easier than ever for people to gain fame. A large amount of followers can launch someone into stardom with little effort, sometimes even by accident! Just as quickly, celebrities can disappear from the limelight for a multitude of reasons. Fame has become a quickly changing facet of our culture because we have so many ways to connect with the world. We also answer a letter from a listener who is worried her fangirling might cross the line into obsession."</p>

	<p>A month ago, I had my first protesting experience at the Women's March in New York City. It was so empowering to be around thousands of other humans and animals in support of women's rights and equality. Since the first march, which I did not attend, I knew I wanted to be a part of it this year. And let me tell you - it did not disappoint.</p>
	<p>I learned so many things that day and I hope you can use these tips and pointers to optimize your protesting/march experience.</p>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
	<p>1. <b>Get there early</b>. I made the mistake of getting to the Women's March a few minutes before it officially started. With how large it was I didn't get to start walking for over an hour. Oops! One benefit was that I got to stick to the outside of the crowd for fresh air and space.</p>
	<p>2. <b>Have a sign with a handle</b>. Holding a sign with one hand is more comfortable than two. I didn't have a handle on my sign and was jealous of everyone who did. It was hard to take pictures and send texts to others.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Have content on both sides of your sign</b>. I didn't realize this beforehand, but when it hit me I felt pretty silly. In a march, most people who see your sign are actually <b>behind you</b>. Yes, there are people on the sidelines cheering you on, but give a little something to fellow protesters behind you so they aren't staring at a blank sign the whole time.</p>
	<img className="two-up" src="/images/protest1.jpg" alt="Protest 1" />
	<img className="two-up" src="/images/protest2.jpg" alt="Protest 2" />
	<br></br>
	<p>4. <b>Be prepared for hecklers</b> - There's always a yin to the yang, especially in a protest. There is likely going to be others who are counter-protesting or will say/do things that attempt to weaken your protest. Always remember to stick to your "why" and march forward. You have support around you, lean on them.</p>
	<p>5. <b>Use the buddy system</b>. Emotions are high for everyone during a march, no matter what your views are and it's better to be safe than sorry. I went with a co-worker to the March and my boyfriend was home as my emergency contact. Because there were so many people at the Women's March my phone actually didn't work for most of it and my phone started draining quickly so I kept it on Airplane Mode to take pictures (see tip #9).</p>
	<p>6. <b>Talk with the people around you</b> - You know your "why", take the time to learn about others'. At the Women's March, it was so inspiring to chat with the people around me. We all have so many different experiences that add to our collective voice.</p>
	<p>7. <b>Take notes of what's on other signs</b> - You'll want to remember all of the creativity and cleverness on protest signs, but you won't. Take notes in your phone to write down ones you like! I had quite the list collected by the end that I can't wait to use as inspiration for my next protest. If you want me to share the list on this site, leave me a comment below!</p>
	<p>8. <b>Bring snacks + water</b>. Take a little backpack with you to put bottles of water and snacks. The Women's March was many hours, and there was lots of yelling and cheering. Stay hydrated and energized to fuel your activism.</p>
	<p>9. <b>Document the experience</b> - This should go without saying at this day and age, but nevertheless, definitely do it. I took both pictures and videos, saved Instagram Stories and Snapchats. </p>
	<p>10. <b>Share your story</b> - I'm hoping that years from now and generations to come I can still share my experience. By sharing your story and adding to the archives of activism, you are paying it forward and leading  by example. Channel your energy in to <b>action</b>. You never know, you may inspire other people to protest too.</p>
	<p>Protesting is powerful and inspiring. It's important to speak your truth, share your story, and exercise your right to free speech. I hope these tips help whether it's your first of your 100th protest.</p>
	<p>Have you been to a protest or march? If so, share your tips below for others to learn from!</p>

	<p>One thing you quickly learn either visiting or living in NYC is that it's really easy to spend money whether you want to or not. It's a much more active process to live on a budget. And I understand it's like that everywhere, but in this city you can't walk a block without passing store and restaurant windows that magically open your wallet. Sometimes it's worth it, and sometimes you get thoughts like "I could have made that dinner myself."</p>
	<p>No matter the time of year, these budget-friendly date ideas are great options for you to do solo (#selflovematters) or with your loved one(s). These dates have been tested over and over with my significant other, and they never disappoint.</p>
	<p>1. <b>Museums:</b> ($0 - Pay as you wish/person)</p>
		<img src="/images/amnhmember.jpg" alt="American Museum of Natural History" />
	<p>There are museums with paid entry, ones that are "pay as you wish", and ones with special deals on certain days of the week. Here is a great website for reference with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nyc-arts.org/collections/35/free-museum-days-or-pay-what-you-wish">free museum days</a>. My personal favorites are the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/">Metropolitan Museum</a>.</p>
	<p>2. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/">Central Park</a>:</b> ($0/person)</p>
		<img src="/images/centralparkpicnic.jpg" alt="Central Park" />
	<p>Take a walk through Central Park. Don't be tricked into getting around with the carriages or bikes if you're on a budget - you pay for these by the MINUTE (use Citi Bike instead… keep reading). If you'd like, take some food from the nearby grocery and have yourself a picnic on the Great Lawn or one of the many benches throughout the expansive park. There are also tours throughout the day that are free if you want to learn some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/events/">Central Park fun facts</a>!</p>
	<p>3. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/">Citi Bike</a> through the city:</b> ($12/day-$14.95/month annual commitment)</p>
		<img src="/images/citi-bike.jpg" alt="Citi Bike NYC" />
	<p>One way to get around besides walking, metro, cab, there's also a bike share program called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/">Citi Bike</a>. There are over 6,000 stations throughout the city and the day or year passes afford you unlimited rides. The day pass gives you 30 minutes per ride, and the year pass gives you 45 minutes per ride. My boyfriend and I will bike around and when time is getting close to the limit, we return at the nearest station and unlock another bike. One of our favorite ways to use this is to bike through Central Park.</p>
	<p>4. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bryantpark.org/amenities/bank-of-america-winter-village-at-bryant-park">Ice Skating in Bryant Park</a>:</b> ($0 - $20/person)</p>
		<img src="/images/bryantparkrink.jpg" alt="Bryant Park Rink" />
	<p>The Rink is open generally from October to March and is especially great during the holidays with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bryantpark.org/amenities/bank-of-america-winter-village-at-bryant-park">Winter Village</a>. Admission is FREE and if you have your own ice skates, you're good to go! They do have the option to rent skates for $20 per pair. Bryant Park is one of my favorite parks in NYC (can't beat Central Park, but this is high up on the list) and it's right in the middle of some tall buildings and great shopping.</p>
	<p>5. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nypl.org/locations/mid-manhattan-library">New York Public Library, Mid-Manhattan location</a>:</b> ($0/person)</p>
		<img src="/images/nypl.jpg" alt="New York Public Library Mid-Manhattan" />
	<p>After a nice skating workout, check out the New York Public Library while you're at it. It's right next door! There are beautiful, history sites and collection all throughout the interior. It's a great date location for quiet, calm, cultural learning together. In addition to the sites inside, there is a whole <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nypl.org/events/calendar?location=45">calendar of events</a> that are available for the public.</p>

	<p>6. <b>Home-Cooked Dinner + Streaming:</b> ($0-whatever grocery budget you decide!)</p>
		<img src="/images/homecookedmeal.jpg" alt="Home Cooked Dinner" />
	<p>Tried and true, stay-at-home, DIY classic date. One of my favorite things to do with my significant other is cook and stream a TV show or movie on Amazon Prime, Netflix, or HBO (no Hulu yet!). These streams provide tons of choices for a great date night, especially when your local theater in NYC is $16-18 per movie ticket (unless you get Movie Pass… keep on reading)!</p>
	<p>7. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.moviepass.com/">Movie Pass</a>:</b> ($9.95/month)</p>
		<img src="/images/moviepass.jpg" alt="Wrinkle In Time Movie Pass" />
	<p>I talked about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.moviepass.com/">Movie Pass</a> in my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2nY1tsT">5 Things I Loved in January</a> post and continue to be in love with it! When the movie theater tickets run over $16 here plus the inevitable popcorn and drinks, one-time use of the Movie Pass more than pays for itself. So if you're tired of your streaming options, you can still go to the theater with this great option.</p>

	<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thepit-nyc.com/">People's Improv Theater (PIT)</a> is a training center and comedy theater where you can see trainees and up-and-coming comedians perform at really affordable prices. There are shows, open mic nights, and class performances from all levels. If you're tired of drink limits at your comedy shows, this place is for you too. On their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thepit-nyc.com/events">calendar of events</a> you can see upcoming shows and prices.</p>
	<p>9. <b>Happy Hour:</b> ($10-$30/person)</p>
		<img src="/images/happyhour.jpg" alt="Happy Hour" />
	<p>If you still want to go out but don't want the full-blown dinner entrée + drinks, Happy Hour is the way to go. They have drink and food specials throughout the city. Most of my recommendations are around my 'hood, the Upper West Side. My favorite spot is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ellakitchenbar.com/">Ella Kitchen and Bar</a> (tapas, Sangria, cocktails).</p>
	<p>Other options include:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://e-barnyc.com/"> E's Bar</a> (board games, beer, burgers)</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.beerculture.nyc/gebhards">Gebhard's Beer Culture</a> (shuffle board, beer, chili, nachos)</p>

		<img src="/images/julliardschool.jpg" alt="Julliard School" />
	<p>This is a new one for me, and I am so excited to explore this more often. Over the summer, there are tons of free performances in parks but other than that I haven't figured out a way to quench my classical arts thirst in an affordable way. Then it was suggested to me to check out the Julliard performance calendar and it's absolutely perfect. So many performances and recitals almost every day. Some are free, most are $30/ticket (which is so much cheaper than Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center) and $15/ticket for a fulltime non-Julliard student.</p>

	<p>So far this year, my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bit.ly/2mCwVg9">19 Goals Before 2019</a> post has been the most popular one. Because of that, I decided to keep you all updated each month with my progress to ensure they weren't just goals made on a whim and show you how I plan to accomplish them, step-by-step.</p>
	<p>If you're enjoying this kind of content, be sure to <b>let me know in the comment section</b>! </p>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
	<h4>personal.</h4>
		<p>1. Run a 5K in Manhattan - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I set a weekly goal to start running 1 mile per week, and I did it! By the last week of January, I actually ran 2 miles twice in one week. My February goal is to do 2 miles twice per week consistently with the goal of 3 miles once per week by the end.</p>
		<p>2. Travel out of the country twice - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">This goal is officially <b>in progress</b>! My boyfriend and I have booked a trip to Barcelona in May, after jumping on an alert from Scott's Cheap Flights. I'm so excited and currently doing a lot of research of places to go and things to do. If you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments section!</p>
		<p>3. Participate in a protest/march - <b>COMPLETE!</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Women's march. 'Nuff said. ✓</p>
		<p>4. Submit 10 essays/articles for websites - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Submitting 10 essays/articles means creating new content not for my own, so this requires some extra effort. The first step I wanted to do was collate a list of websites that would accept articles. I've collected a list of 12 and will work on outlines for a few in February as the next step.</p>
		<p>5. Take a creative writing course - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">This one I did a little bit of research for in January. Through my work, I have some education credits where I can take courses with reimbursed tuition at places like Columbia University (!). I looked at some class schedules for creative writing courses at Columbia to see that they existed in the first place. They have classes for fiction, non-fiction, writing memoirs, and so much more. I hope to explore some options when I know that I will not be traveling so much.</p>
		<p>6. Learn how to curl hair with a curler - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Haven't make much progress here; but I watched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qulMLhziCA">Estée  Lalonde's video</a> to inspire me to buy a curler! In February I will commit to doing more research. Buying new larger products takes time for me; I've also had the same hair straightener since high school and it's still going strong, so I want this curler purchase to be a good one.</p>
		<p>7. Pay more rent than student loan bill each month - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I'm proud to say that I paid >$1000 more than the bill I owed. It's put me in "pay-ahead" status for a lot of my loans and thus my February has $0.00 due. I plan to continue paying them off since this means they will go towards my principal balance, not the interest!</p>
		<p>8. Wear more lipstick - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Did not do so well with this one in January. Work got busy and I wanted more sleep in the mornings. These are not good excuses. But alas, they are my excuses. I will work better on this in February and beyond. I think the struggle here is that it's not a SMART goal. What's the objective? How will I know I've achieved this? I will need to figure this out for this to feel accomplished.</p>
		<p>9. Finish Project Pan 2018 (18 skin care/make up products) - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I've finished 2 products so far! If you're interested in me writing a post about what my 18 products are, leave me a comment below!</p>
		<p>10. Explore all of the New York City boroughs - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I didn't get out of Manhattan much this month at all! In February, I hope to go to Queens or Brooklyn.</p>
		<p>11. Go to a cultural/activist event every month - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">Does Women's March count for January? It should.</p>
	<h4>coffee meets polished.</h4>
		<p>12. Reach 500 followers on Instagram - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I reached 300 followers by the end of January! And as of today, I am at 335. Inching my way to 500 and hope to surpass it way before the year is out.</p>
		<p>13. Reach 100 MailChimp subscriptions - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">This one is a bit more difficult. I gained 9 more subscribers, but have some strategies in my back pocket that are planned. Stay tuned!</p>
		<p>14. Reach 500 followers of Twitter - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I've reached 300 followers by the end of January, just like Instagram! I'm confident this goal will be achieved.</p>
		<p>15. Start YouTube channel - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">No plans to create the channel quite yet. Well, I have plans, but it's lower on my personal strategic plan (more to come). </p>
		<p>16. Create worksheets for reader downloads - <b>IN PROGRESS</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I've drafted ideas for worksheets, but need to learn how to create them digitally! Final drafts will be worked on in February as next steps.</p>
		<p>17. Finish draft for merchandise - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I have a list of ideas, but nothing in final draft stages. More to come in the next months, but honestly no progress has been made.</p>
		<p>18. Create a monthly challenge - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I didn't pursue some of my ideas this month. I was hoping to do a "self love" challenge in February but clearly that didn't pan out. I have more ideas for later months and hope to have one planned out far enough in advance.</p>
		<p>19. Do a giveaway and/or collaboration - <b>NOT STARTED</b></p>
		<p className="tabbed">I honestly haven't gotten the guts yet to reach out for a collaboration. But I'm hoping once I reach some of my follower milestones that I'll do a giveaway. I'm excited to keep growing and expanding with other content creators!</p>
		<p>Each month it's important to celebrate your progress and not get bogged down with how many more "in progress" and "not started" there are compared to "complete". Focus on <b>continuous improvement</b>. Our job is rarely completely finished, especially when it comes to our personal growth.</p>

Then it pivoted to an avenue to expand my knowledge using auditory learning, and I'm developing quite the expansive subscription list. Here are my absolute favorites from January, which includes new podcasts discoveries and topics on politics, race, identity, and feminism. </p>
	<h4>❖❖❖</h4>
	<h4><b>favorite new discovery.</b></h4>
	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://radiowolfgang.com/s/the-heart-of-it-with-est%C3%A9e-lalonde">The Heart of It with Estée Lalonde</a></b>: One of my favorite online creators and influencers, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.esteelalonde.com/">Estée Lalonde</a>, created a podcast and season one was last year. I only started listening to it this January and once I listened to one, I binge-listened to all of them. Needless to say, I CAN'T WAIT for season two. One channel description says:</p>
	<p>"In this series, lifestyle blogger and author, Estée Lalonde explores subjects close to her heart, through the unique experiences and perspectives of her guests. This season, it's all about women. From makeup to identity, tattoos to strength, Estée talks to fascinating individuals from all walks of life as they share their personal stories in a celebration of all things female."</p>
	<p>It's really difficult for me to pick one, but if I had to, it would be the episode on <b>Identity</b>. She talks about her Canadian roots combined with her immigration to Britain, and other components of the "recipe of Estée". Topics surrounding nationality, heritage, codeswitching, and relating to others are discussed.</p>

But is this nastiness really worse than in previous eras, and if so, what does that mean for our democracy? Historian David Moss takes the long view.

This is the follow-up series created after <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/presidential-podcast/">Washington Post's Presidential Podcast</a>, which I will be listening to next. Constitutional episodes are set up how I wish my AP U.S. History class was in high school. But perhaps I wasn't in a place yet to appreciate how history ties into most of what we experience today. Better late than never, right? My favorite episode so far (there are many great ones) was on the First Amendment.

	<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unladylike.co/episodes">Unladylike</a></b>: This channel premiered in January and came out with a bang talking about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unladylike.co/episodes/01payforabortion">how to pay for an abortion</a>. I think it's extremely important to bring up controversial or "taboo" topics and break down why they may be that way. And once you discover reasons why topics have been deemed "unladylike", challenge it and normalize it. Abortion is not an easy topic to do without causing extreme divisiveness that clouds the conversation. The style of this podcast is to go full force into a topic and provide tools of support. If you haven't yet, definitely see their other episodes so far.</p>

One of the episodes in January was around "non-romantic rejection". When I saw the title, I wasn't sure what it was about but when I read the description found it extremely relatable and grateful that it was being discussed. The description is:</p>
	<p>"Our friend Chris Klemens joins us this week to talk about rejection. Being involuntary forced to leave a job or professional relationship can swirl you into a downpour of emotion: embarrassment, depression, worthlessness, self-pity and shame. As someone who recently got fired, Chris gives us insight into how that feeling of failure affected his self-worth. Cat unexpectedly reached the end of a professional relationship, and her confidence took a massive hit. Your identity is deeply embedded with what you do, so how does being rejected affect your relationship to vulnerability in your life?"</p>

	<p>This month felt like it went by faster than others. Do I say that every month?  After an amazing holiday season with family, New York City welcomed me back with frigid temperatures after a canceled flight due to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/3/16845048/winter-storm-2018-bomb-cyclone-blizzard-florida-new-york-boston-new-england">bomb cyclone</a>.

	<p>Having to leave my newborn nephew was pretty difficult, especially with how much time I got to spend with him. I definitely had my withdrawal period that was mitigated by video call capabilities! Thank goodness for technology making our worlds smaller.</p>

	<p>My mom recently picked up the skill of knitting and it's been perfect timing for winter in New York City. She's made hats, ear warmers, leg warmers, and more. In fact, she has a dedicated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/joys_knits_and_purls/?hl=en">Instagram for her masterpieces</a>!

	<p>Improving my cultural and activist literacy through my earbuds has been very effective and enjoyable particularly this month. At first, I used podcasts for the daily news on my way to work, and then for learning more about feminism. Now I have expanded my podcast diversity to US history, self-care, finance, and more.</p>

	<h4><b>runs in central park.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/centralparkonassis.jpg" alt="Central Park Onassis" />
	<p>One of my goals this year is to run a 5K. Considering I'm a homebody and like to lay in bed all day if I have the choice, it's a long road ahead to achieve this. However, I've been making smart goals to do it step-by-step and not burn out trying to accomplish it. In January, my goal was to run one mile, once per week. I achieved this goal and even pushed to 2 miles, twice per week by the last week of January. It's hard to stop running when you're in Central Park! Fun fact, the picture above was featured on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeWOU3qFjNG/?hl=en&taken-by=centralparknyc">Central Park's Instagram</a>!</p>

	<h4><b>movie pass.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/moviepass.jpg" alt="Movie Pass Wrinkle In Time" />
	<p>The theaters around me are $16+ per movie ticket, and $8+ for Sunday matinee. That can cause quite a dent to the credit card bill! I was introduced to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.moviepass.com/">Movie Pass</a>, which is a $9.99/month subscription that allows you to watch one movie per day. They send you a card that refills with what you need to purchase a ticket either at the kiosk or at the counter. I saw two movies in January which was worth $32! The subscription more than paid for itself with one movie. Highly recommend.</p>

	<p>I try not to have regrets, but one last year was definitely not participating in the Women's March. Oh, how I wish I could be part of the millions who marched in their pussy hats and scream, "This is what democracy looks like!" Looking at the pictures, published magazines and books, and hearing stories from others I experience some serious FOMO especially with the level of empowerment I feel now. Last year, I don't know how I didn't participate but the only excuse I have is the same one that caused me to black out from the world around me: residency.</p>
	<p>But it's a new day, a new year, and now I live in New York City where the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-womens-march-on-nyc-tickets-39150171216">2018 Women's March NYC</a> already has over 85,000 registered marchers as of yesterday.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h4><b>I'm one of them.</b></h4>
	<br></br>
	<img src="/images/nastywomenunite.jpg" alt="Nasty Women Unite" />
	<p>Last year, the Women's March was hosted in Washington D.C. (and all over the country) and was the largest single-day protest in American history, with other marches around the world on the same day.  It was born out of resistance to the new administration in the White House and in support of equality for all.</p>

	<p>This year, the march's theme is <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.powertothepolls.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power to the Polls</a></b> and officially being held in Las Vegas. The goal of this year's Power to the Polls event to launch a national voter registration tour to "channel the energy and activism into tangible strategies and concrete wins in 2018". <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.womensmarch.com/register/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to register to VOTE!</a></b></p>
	<p>One reason it is being held in Las Vegas is because Nevada is a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm elections. Another reason is because the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history happened there in 2017.</p>
	<p>I will admit, I had confusion as to when the other marches were vs. the Women's March anniversary event. Here's the scoop:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">1. The Women's March event is being held on <b>Sunday, January 21st,</b> the one-year anniversary of the 2017 protest. It will be held at Sam Boyd Stadium and will be streamed live for those who cannot make it.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">2. Everywhere else in the country, there are marches and events planned for <b>Saturday, January 20th</b>.  The Women's March website has a handy directory of event where you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.womensmarch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">search for events</a> to participate near your zip code.</p>

	<h4><b>What else does Women's March have going on?</b></h4>
		<br></br>
	<img src="/images/fightlikeagirl.jpg" alt="Womens March Empower" />
		<br></br>
	<p>The initiative of Women's March Youth, called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.womensmarch.com/empower/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women's March EMPOWER</a>, seek to "provide young people with the tools needed to create high school and college chapters that guide students in making a positive impact in their communities". They have a great 4-part printable toolkit to provide tangible resources for our youth to become leaders in their communities. The initiative is in partnership with Rock the Vote, Teen Vogue, Peace First, Rise to Run, The Gathering for Justice, and Justice League NYC.</p>
		<br></br>
	<img src="/images/togetherwerisecover.jpg" alt="Together We Rise Cover" />

	<p>Women's March also published a book that came out this week, called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062843435/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062843435&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=f020f6f7d7d161f3199cc45d43dd929c">Together We Rise: Behind the Scenes at the Protest Heard Around the World</a>. It is a full-color book that show behind-the-scenes images of the 2017 Women's March. In addition to the images it interweaves a series of essays by writers, celebrities, and artists including Jill Soloway, America Ferrera, Roxane Gay, Ilana Glazer, and more. Proceeds from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.womensmarch.com/togetherwerise/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Together we Rise</a> will be shared between three grassroots, women-led organizations: The Gathering for Justice, SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, and Indigenous Women Rise.</p>

	<div>
	<img src="/images/normalizedconvoperiods.png" alt="Topics to Normalize:Periods" />
	<p>I spent a lot of 2017 reflecting on certain topics that are considered "taboo" and tried to figure out why they were categorized as such. I observed attitudes of different generations, genders, and races on topics that illicit visceral reactions, problematic thoughts, and conflicting conversation.</p>
	<p>In today's kick off to the series, we're talking about <b>PERIODS</b>.</p>
	<p>These opinions are my own. My hope is that after reading this, it sparks some thoughts for you too.</p>
	<p>I realized that many women are uncomfortable asking if fellow ladies have an extra tampon or pad (since they're not readily available in public bathrooms for free). I was recently asked this by someone whispering in my ear, and I thought, "Wouldn't it be nice to live in a world where we can ask these things aloud and not feel embarrassed, or feel like others may feel uncomfortable?"</p>
	<p>I believe periods have become taboo because history set up and society today reinforces the notion that periods are unhealthy, gross, or something to be ashamed of because women "aren't at their best" while on periods. This is perpetuated by the <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/03/02/period-stigma/?linkId=21898002#AVSGx7scxuqQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lack of adequate period education</a> for both women and men.</p>
	<p>There are real consequences to the silencing (intended or unintended) of this topic. In some countries, women are still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/world/asia/nepal-woman-menstruation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent to huts</a> while on her period or <a href="http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/en/NewsDetail/index/7/7836/Menstruation-Keeps-Girls-From-School-In-India-20-Drop-Out-Reaching-Puberty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stay home from school</a> because of lack of appropriate bathrooms and products to use. There's a luxury tax on tampons. <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/434qzg/prisons-are-still-charging-female-inmates-for-having-their-periods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incarcerated women are still struggling</a> for free feminine hygiene products.</p>
	<p>Not promoting openness and awareness with periods allows the silence to continue for those who suffer from the consequences. Here are some suggestions to normalize period talk:</p>
		<h4><b>women.</b></h4>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Understand the biology of periods and learn to love the amazing complexity of our bodies.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Ask for pads and tampons aloud whether men are present or not.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Support openness when women wish to discuss our periods with you.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Don't be ashamed of your period underwear.</p> 
		<h4><b>men.</b></h4>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Support openness when women wish to discuss our periods with you.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Empathize with women if they are feeling uncomfortable and/or in pain because they are on their periods.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Don't assume a bad mood is because she is hormonal (due to periods).</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Do not react when women discuss periods or ask for pads/tampons in front of you.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢<a href="https://medium.com/clued-in/the-manly-guide-to-menstruation-833d97d811ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean in, and learn</a>.</p>
		<h4><b>policymakers.</b></h4>
	<p className="tabbed">➢<a href="https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/434qzg/prisons-are-still-charging-female-inmates-for-having-their-periods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ensure compliance</a> with the new law requiring free tampons and pads in federal prisons.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Remove luxury tampon tax across the country.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Promote period education in schools.</p>	
		<h4><b>advertising and marketing.</b></h4>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Make commercials and ads for tampons and pads contain red liquid, not blue liquid, to more accurately represent a woman's period.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Involve more women in development of advertising to ensure messages that relate most closely to the key demographic.</p>
	<p>There are many ways to change a conversation, but it takes a collective voice, and one person at a time.</p>

	<p>"Starting today, we're asking people to share what they're #HopefulFor next year. I'm #HopefulFor a world where we elevate all women's voices and help get more women – especially those from groups that have been traditionally marginalized – into positions of power. Our time is now."</p>
	<p>This inspired me to reflect what I'm hopeful for this year. I realized that there is a lot I'm hopeful for, and while this list may seem ambitious I hope to add to the archives of hopes and dreams for the future.</p>
		<h4><b>women.</b></h4>
	<p>➢Women to continue momentum to stand our ground, be heard, and reckoned with</p>
	<p>➢Women not to be burdened with emotional labor that isn't ours</p>
	<p>➢Women to be valued and marketed towards for our minds and talents, not our looks</p>
		<h4><b>men.</b></h4>
	<p>➢More men to amplify women's voices</p>
	<p>➢Men to have the space to express their emotions in a healthy, productive way</p>
	<p>➢Masculinity to be culturally evolved to incorporate equality with strength</p>
		<h4><b>introverts.</b></h4>
	<p>➢Introverts to be asked for our opinion if we don't say something</p>
	<p>➢Quiet and shy not to be thought of as the same</p>
	<p>➢Solitude to be seen as a necessity, not a commodity</p>
		<h4><b>policy.</b></h4>
	<p>➢Paid family leave for the entire gender spectrum</p>
	<p>➢Reproductive freedoms for women</p>
	<p>➢Equal pay for everyone with the same job title and standardized merit-based raises</p>
	<p> These may seem more like part of a 5-year strategic plan, and maybe it will be someday. For now, I'll spend this year focusing on changing conversations, taking action, and organizing others to make these hopes a reality.</p>

	<p>I know I'm really behind on the Podcast bandwagon, but now I can't get enough. I'm able to listen to episodes when I'm walking throughout the City and on the train and it lets me take my eyes off my phone while in transit. Not only that, but it's a new avenue of content where I can improve my literacy on current events and cultural topics. These were my favorite ones of the year, or at least last 5 months since moving to New York.</p>
		<h4><b>Lessons from a year full of toxic masculinity</b></h4>
	<p>An interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umKKrbmdHFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wade Davis</a>, the NFL's first Diversity and Inclusion consultant and, well, a professional feminist. (Ok, maybe that one's not on his business card). Davis uses his public platform to talk to men and boys about masculinity as a societal construct -- one that is a performance as harmful to men as it is to women. We'll also hear from Vox.com reporter <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/11/6/16571570/female-candidates-trump-clinton-2016-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna North</a>, who attended the Women's Convention in Detroit and talked to women interested in running for office in 2018 about how Donald Trump's win, and Hillary Clinton's loss, have motivated their candidacies.</p>

		<h4><b>Does Marriage Make Women Happy?</b></h4>
	<p>What are the benefits of marriage for women? Liz Plank talks to feminist writer Jill Fillipovic about how the institution has changed over the last decade, and what that means for women’s happiness and economic stability in 2017. Hitha Herzog is hiding in a closet at her sister’s wedding, but she calls in to talk about the pragmatism of her marriage being governed by “1950s” values.</p>

		<h4><b>The Edge of Gender</b></h4>
	<p>Gender is one of the first things we notice about the people around us. But where do our ideas about gender come from? Can gender differences be explained by genes and chromosomes, or are they the result of upbringing, culture and the environment? This week, we delve into the debate over nature vs. nurture, and meet the first person in the United States to officially reject the labels of both male and female, and be recognized as "non-binary."</p>

		<h4><b>Misbehaving with Richard Thaler</b></h4>
	<p>We don't always do what we're supposed to do. We don't save enough for retirement. We order dessert — even when we're supposed to be dieting. In other words, we misbehave. That's the title of Richard Thaler's most recent book: Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics. If you've read Thaler's previous book, Nudge, you know he's an economist who studies why people don't really act the way traditional economists say they will. Thaler recently won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to the field of behavioral economics — so we thought we'd celebrate by giving you this encore episode. It's still one of our favorites.</p>

		<h4><b>When Women Say I'm Sorry</b></h4> 
	<p>Apologizing is an important step towards reconciliation, but sometimes we say "sorry" too much. Why do women typically apologize more than men? Can you still be a feminist and use these undermining words? How can you be more aware of them in your everyday speech? We also investigate the issues of assuming girls are "more difficult," the dilemma of policing how women speak, and a letter from a listener who wants to stop over-apologizing at work. Language is one of the essential ways we express ourselves, and ultimately your vocabulary is your choice. How will your use of words make you feel you proud and confident about who you are?</p>
	<p className="centered"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" title="Sorry" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/318210449&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></p>
		<h4><b>Women and the Trades</b></h4>
	<p>Women are underrepresented in trades like autoworking, plumbing, and welding. E&B unpack what can be done to increase representation of women in these critical fields.</p>
	<p className="centered"><iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.howstuffworks.com/embed/928441" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen title="Trade"></iframe></p>
		<h4><b>Pregnant in Prison</b></h4>
	<p>How should we be treating imprisoned pregnant women? Perhaps we could start by not shackling them to the hospital bed during labor.</p>

		<h4><b>Problematic Faves: Judge Judy</b></h4>
	<p>Are you a fan of someone...even though you KNOW their record on feminist issues isn't exactly stellar? Today we're introducing a series profiling women we love, imperfections and all. First up? The queen of courtroom TV: Judge Judy.</p>
	<p className="centered"><iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.howstuffworks.com/embed/928557" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen title="Judge Judy"></iframe></p>

	<p>There's a lot to be said for writing down goals. It holds me accountable. And I'd like to tell myself that publishing it online means I'll be extra accountable. Right?</p>
	<p>This list was inspired after doing research for my new bullet journal for 2019. I saw some spreads of this "19 by 2019" thing where people write down 19 goals they hope to achieve before the end of the year 2019. I thought it was interesting and decided to reflect and see if I would be able to come up with 19 things I wanted to accomplish.</p>
	<p>It turns out I do. As I curated the list, two natural categories came out of it. One of my life, and one for this blog and the Coffee Meets Polished brand. I hope this list gives you some ideas of what you may want to pursue this year, and give you a sneak peak of some future projects for CMP.</p>
	<h4><b>personal.</b></h4>
	<p>1. Run a 5K in Manhattan<br></br>
	2. Travel out of the country twice <br></br>
	3. Participate in a protest/march<br></br>
	4. Submit 10 essays/articles for websites<br></br>
	5. Take a creative writing course <br></br>

	7. Pay more rent than student loan bill each month <br></br>
	8. Wear more lipstick <br></br>
	9. Finish Project Pan 2018 (18 skin care/make up products)<br></br>
	10. Explore all of the New York City boroughs <br></br>

	18. Create a monthly challenge <br></br>
	19. Do a giveaway and/or collaboration </p>
	<p>I do have this as a spread in my bullet journal, but it's not pretty like most others' out there so I'll stick with the digital list. Cheers to 2018 goals, everyone!</p>

	<div>
	<img src="/images/highsof2017.jpg" alt="Baby Zeke" />
	<p>I had a pretty eventful 2017, and so did the United States of America and world. My personal life had moments that inspired me and broke me down. The world around me felt turbulent and bubbling with momentum for change. Conversations are coming forward, being challenged, and changing. Awareness is becoming acute enough to recognize subtle nuance, implicit bias, and unfair institutionalized limits for certain populations.</p>
	<p>Some people say that things have to get worse before they get better. I always tell myself this when I clean. I have to remove everything from their original places to declutter, re-organize, and have a fresh start. The same went for my 2017 experience.</p>
	<p>Here are my top five and bottom five moments of the past year, starting with the lowest of the low so we can end on a high note.</p>
	<h4><b>lows.</b></h4>
	<p>1. <b>Burnout.</b> Most of the lows happened related to residency. One of them was the burnout. I felt stretched thin with tons of assignments and short deadlines. I don't remember ever being so busy or feeling so overwhelmed. The positive out of it is that I know my limits, and I know that they can be stretched and expanded. I also have new appreciations for wellness and selfcare.</p>
	<p>2. <b>Worthlessness.</b> The volume of work that caused burnout was layered with feedback that was sometimes unedited, unproductive, and the hardest kind: true. When you're not your best self mentally/physically/emotionally, feedback is not something you have the capacity to take and process healthily. The only way I found out of the darkness and put together the pieces are my mentors, friends, and family. These are the times you realize how valuable humility is and how important support structures are.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Uncertainty.</b> The third layer of this was the whole point of doing residency in the first place: employment. It was difficult to complete my daily, monthly, quarterly, annual, two-year deadlines; recruit the next class of residents to replace you; while also finding a job. The uncertainty of where you'll live, what you'll be doing, when the alarm clock on your lease is also pending. I was so used to program end dates, application timelines, results dates, that told me on a certain day where I would be and when. Now, it was under my control and I didn't know how to process it.</p>
	<p>4. <b>Politics.</b> This doesn't need explaining. I don't want to oversimplify it by trying to. But if you don't know, please spend 2018 improving your literacy on current events. You won't regret it.</p>
	<p> 5. <b>Student Loan Debt.</b> I made it a goal for my second year of residency to begin paying my student loans even through deferment. I succeeded with that goal and now am embarking on the journey through repayment plans. The reason this is a low is because of the principles behind why I have to pay them in the first place. I am frustrated with the burden placed on people who are determined to get a higher education, to provide for themselves with jobs that contribute to the workforce. To be locked into decisions made in a time when I barely knew who I was and without alternatives. All I can tell myself is that things will work out and I'll be able to pay them off. But why are tuitions so high? Why do colleges and universities get to profit from students who pursue their dreams, or paths that were imposed on them by their parents and society? What if I had changed my mind or wasn't able to find a job to pay the loan bill taken out for said job? I have many thoughts on this topic, if you couldn't tell.</p>
	<p>Now that the lows are out of the way (and how cathartic that was), time for the happy times!</p>
	<h4><b>highs.</b></h4>
	<p>1. <b>Love.</b> Before residency started in 2015, I spent a lot of time alone reflecting. My goal was to be able to do things on my own. Eat at restaurants, go to movies, shop, and make decisions for me. Once I felt comfortable doing all of these things, I found the one. It was quite amazing timing. And two years later it's like spending every day with my best friend who doesn't make me feel like I need to change anything about me but supports my hopes for self-improvement and dreams for the future. So this is what happiness with a significant other feels like, who knew?</p>
	<p>2. <b>Moving to New York City.</b> Remember those feelings of burnout, uncertainty, and worthlessness? Well, those were squashed (after plenty of wallowing) and out popped an opportunity to where I now agree to be the greatest city in the world. A lot of people ask me how long I plan to be there as if New York City has been a temporary Millenial phase. But now that I've been here almost 7 months, I don't see an end to it. It may be because it's the first time I've not had an end date imposed on me, but I also believe it's because I love it here. And that's, that.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Job status.</b> This is a high because it's the reason for all of the lows and triumphs throughout the last 10 years since graduating high school and leaving home. The really expensive mansion that is my student loans, long days, little sleep, tears, new friends, and Tar Heel adventures culminated to the job that I wanted all along. I finally have autonomy to make decisions and analyze situations without the 24/7 feedback loop of residency. I get to find my style and see how I do on my own two feet with a great boss to work with. It's a great situation so far.</p>
	<p>4. <b>New Baby.</b> My little sister gave birth to a beautiful baby boy in 2017. His name is Zeke (short for Ezekiel) and I got to spend a whole 12 days with him. I created some deep bonds that he won't remember since he's less than a month old but I'll keep with me forever. I can't wait for him to visit (and his parents too, of course).</p>
	<p>5. <b>Empowerment.</b> If 2017 was filled with anything it was filled with my highest levels of empowerment. Like a phoenix from the ashes I feel like I came out of a tough training period with resolve to succeed in what I wanted and the environment of New York City only amplifies it.</p>
	<p>I can't wait to see what 2018 has in store. Even though 2017 had lows, it had many more highs that absolutely outweighed them. I will continue seeking the positive outcomes and lessons in any situation. While I'm imperfect and problematic, I now believe those traits to be great things because they are part of who I am.</p>

	<p>December was filled with new experiences in New York City, and new life in my family. Here are 5 things I loved this month.</p>
	<h4><b>new nephew.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/babyzeke.jpg" alt="Baby Zeke" />
	<p>My nephew was born this month and I was so excited to meet this little bundle of joy! He’s teeny tiny but strong and makes fun faces. I can’t wait to introduce him to New York City someday.</p>
	<h4><b>overdrive app.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/overdriveapp.png" alt="Overdrive App" />
	<p>I mentioned in <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/books-i-read-in-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Books I Read in 2017”</a> that I’d just started getting into audiobooks. In fact, since posting that list I finished one more (Aziz Ansari’s Modern Romance). I discovered how to borrow audiobooks and e-books through the <a href= "https://app.overdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overdrive App</a> that connects to the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Public Library</a>. It’s been really amazing to be able to borrow these for free.</p>
	<h4><b>gopro hero 3+.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/gopro.jpg" alt="Go Pro" />
	<p>Not sure why I never pulled this out even though we’ve had it for years but now I’m all about it. I love being able to discreetly record my experiences with wide angle. And especially while my phone gets filled up pretty easily.</p>
	<h4><b>foodventures with DŌ.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/donyc.jpg" alt="DO NYC" />
	<p>One of this month’s foodventures was edible cookie dough at <a href="https://www.cookiedonyc.com/cookie-dough-confections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DŌ NYC</a>. This particular flavor was Salty and Sweet (sugar cookie + salted caramel + dark chocolate chips + sea salt) and it was amazing. I took a few 8 oz. cartons home for my family and the traveled really well. Tip: freeze them first. I tried all of them raw, but the dough can also be baked.</p>
	<h4><b>amnh membership.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/amnhmember.jpg" alt="AMNH Membership" />
	<p>We got a membership to American Museum of Natural History because there was a $20 discount during the holidays. Usually you pay what you want to enter but the membership helps to support the museum and gives you unlimited entry to temporary exhibits. This month we went into 
	<a href="https://www.amnh.org/global-business-development/traveling-exhibitions/our-senses-an-immersive-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Our Senses</a> which was awesome. It was an immersive experience through all the senses of different animals. Would definitely recommend.</p>
	<p>What were some things you loved this December? I can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2018.</p>

Either because of self-preservation from guilt after not achieving said resolutions or because it corners them into self-improvement goals once a year. I personally take any opportunity to have a fresh start, whether it's a calendar year, academic year, or transition between any major periods in life. It helps me to be able to compartmentalize my goals in this way. Regarding breaking these resolutions, let's face it, sometimes it's the thought and intent that counts.

	<p>There are a lot of people who don’t believe in doing resolutions for the new year. Either because of self-preservation from guilt after not achieving said resolutions or because it corners them into self-improvement goals once a year.</p>
	<p>I personally take any opportunity to have a fresh start, whether it's a calendar year, academic year, or transition between any major periods in life. It helps me to be able to compartmentalize my goals in this way. Regarding breaking these resolutions, let's face it, sometimes it's the thought and intent that counts. Or at least that's what I tell myself.</p>
	<p>There are some real reasons that resolutions don't work. A lot of people will make resolutions that change their being. "I will be more..." sound familiar? The key to resolution success is to do them at a micro level and focus on habit-shifting. Make <a href= "https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/how-to-set-smart-goals-for-yourself" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smarter</a> resolutions that are measurable and realistic. Focus on changing your defaults and autopilots and consider which ones you can have small wins that snowball into larger ones.</p>
	<p>This year was one focused on mental health survival (thank you, residency). In order to survive I first had to know myself, and thus self-awareness was at an all-time high. For 2018, I’m focusing on resolutions that promote better mental health.</p>
	<p>Here’s a list of mental health resolutions, or some may call them <b>intentions</b>, for the upcoming year:</p>
	<b><p className="tabbed">➢ Take a few breaths to absorb a moment before snapping a photo</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Always spend half a day of your weekend with no plans except self-care activities</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Spend 30 min reading at least 3 days per week</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Don't use electronics for the final hour before going to sleep</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Don't check your phone or emails while in bed when you wake up</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Schedule a microadventure alone once per month</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Every time you look at a news feed and feel <a href= "https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fomo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOMO</a>, think of one thing you are grateful for in your life in that moment</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Become more vocal with my feelings and provide timely, productive feedback to others</p></b>
	<p>I hope these give you some ideas for the upcoming year. What are your mental health resolutions for 2018?</p>

Now that I have the strength to place it on my priority list for mindfulness and wellbeing, I'm excited for a whole new world of opportunities to replenish my cultural bucket. I’ve also been going to different feminist events with insightful panelists and it has opened my eyes to the world of feminist literature. If you’re looking for a list to start with to embrace your feminist empowerment, keep on reading. <a href="/articles/feminist-book-list-winter-edition">[Read More]</a></div>, post:

	<p>Winter is here, which means unless I don't have to go outside it's hot tea and a book for me. What I love about feminist books is that it helps wake me up to issues I didn't realize existed because of my particular intersections and experiences. Also, it helps to put words to experiences I have feelings about but don't know how to express yet. And finally, sometimes I just want to know that I'm not alone.</p>
	<p>If you're one of my male readers, please don't think that because this is a "feminist list" that it's not for you. In fact, you should read some of these too. Every time I make progress in my books I discuss it with my boyfriend. It helps me to be able to share what I learn in a productive way, teaches him so he can join the movement (whether he realizes he is or not), and keeps me grounded if I start getting too deep in the trenches and think all men suck.</p>
	<p>I'm excited to start these next year and book club with you all. </p>

	<p>"New York Times bestselling author Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and bodies, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as 'wildly undisciplined,' Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care."</p>

	<p>"For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet."</p>

	<p>"Combining cutting-edge research in genetics, gender, behavior, and cognition—with examples from their own lives and those of other successful women in politics, media, and business—Kay and Shipman go beyond admonishing women to "lean in."Instead, they offer the inspiration and practical advice women need to close the gap and achieve the careers they want and deserve."</p>

	<p>"The highly acclaimed, provocative New York Times bestseller—a personal, eloquently-argued essay, adapted from the much-admired TEDx talk of the same name—from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, award-winning author of Americanah. Here she offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century, one rooted in inclusion and awareness. Drawing extensively on her own experiences and her deep understanding of the often masked realities of sexual politics, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman now—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists."</p>

	<p>"In her comic, scathing essay, "Men Explain Things to Me," Rebecca Solnit took on what often goes wrong in conversations between men and women. She wrote about men who wrongly assume they know things and wrongly assume women don't, about why this arises, and how this aspect of the gender wars works, airing some of her own hilariously awful encounters."</p>

	<p>"Morgan Jerkins is only in her twenties, but she has already established herself as an insightful, brutally honest writer who isn’t afraid of tackling tough, controversial subjects. In This Will Be My Undoing, she takes on perhaps one of the most provocative contemporary topics: What does it mean to “be”—to live as, to exist as—a black woman today? This is a book about black women, but it’s necessary reading for all Americans."</p>

	<p>"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the days before, when she lived and made love with her husband Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now. Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and literary tour de force."</p>

Every neighborhood has its own tree lighting ceremony, each unique in its traditions and history. Major institutions throughout the city also unveil elaborate commissioned trees with intricate themes. I made it to a good number of trees this year. Here’s my list of them and which ones I would/wouldn’t check out again next year. <a href="/articles/nyc-holiday-microadventures-city-trees-2017">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
	<div>
	<img src="/images/winterseve.jpg" alt="Winters Eve Lincoln Center" />
	<p><b>Winter’s Eve at Lincoln Center.</b> I would definitely check this one out again. The tree lighting wasn’t so exciting except for the fact that Lea Salonga was the host and I got to hear her perform live for the first time ever. If you don’t know who Lea Salonga is, she was the voice of Mulan and Jasmine, and performed in the original cast for Les Misérables to name a few roles. What I really liked about this one was that it was an entire festival that spanned the surrounding areas of Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center. It had food, caroling, dance performances, ice sculpting, and more. I enjoyed being able to see what I wanted to at my own pace.</p>
	<img src="/images/centralparklighting.jpg" alt="Central Park Tree Lighting" />
	<p><b>Central Park Tree Lighting.</b> This one wasn’t so exciting. It was on the north part of Central Park and the “flotilla” consisted of a few trees in the distance. It was very local with some Santa photo ops and milk and cookies. Once the lights were on, it was over, and we went home. Would not repeat.</p>
	<img src="/images/bryantparkskatetacular.jpg" alt="Bryant Park Skate-tacular" />
	<p><b>Bryant Park Tree Lighting Skate-tacular.</b> With an event name like this one you can’t go wrong. This one was really spontaneous for me. I was looking at Facebook during my lunch break that day and saw the lineup of hosts and ice skating performers. Then I quickly decided that's what I was doing immediately after work. Hosted by Jane Krakowski (30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) and Olympic and World Champion skaters; including Johnny Weir, Kimmie Meissner, Meryl Davis, Charlie White, and Jeff Buttle. Prepare to get there hours early (with the sun still out) and post up at the edge of the rink. I was able to sit down with my back against the edge of the rink and read a book while everyone else started piling around me. #win. Oh, and YES to a repeat visit next year.</p>
	<img src="/images/rockefellertree.jpg" alt="Rockefeller Tree" />
	<p><b>Rockefeller Center Tree.</b> Please note that I did NOT attend the lighting. I decided that the only way I’ll do it is if I get tickets to see the performers pre-record on the ice rink. Instead I went a couple of weeks later. Please also note that no matter when you go, it WILL be crowded. The crowds just don’t die down around here. It’s also probably because the Saks Fifth Avenue Light Show is right in front of it so it’s double the tourists. This tree has the nostalgia factor for me but it’s also quite beautifully set up with the light angels too. Would go see again next year.</p>
	<img src="/images/washingtonsquareparktree.jpg" alt="Washington Square Park Tree" />
	<p><b>Washington Square Park Tree.</b> This is a tree-lighting I had on my list because it included Christmas caroling and I like Washing Square Park. However, that day I just didn’t feel like it (remember, you have to pace yourself in New York City otherwise you’ll risk holiday burnout). Instead, I went a few weeks later to see it. It was disappointing. Not a great tree with only one color of lights and no ornaments. Now before you get all Charlie Brown Christmas on me, I am all for trees that just needs someone to love it. But this tree was a good tree that didn’t get any love and thus was disappointing. Would not repeat just seeing it next year. But I would like to sing Christmas carols for the lighting next year.</p>
	<img src="/images/origamitree.jpg" alt="AMNH Origami Tree" />
	<p><b>American Museum of Natural History Origami Tree.</b>This tree looks really overwhelming when you first see it, but allot at least 15 minutes to really soak it in. It’s filled with intricate origami pieces that look like they took hours to make each one. They have different themes grouped together to emulate the sections in the museum. It was amazing. Definitely take a look at this one if you get the chance and see the rest of the museum while you’re at it. I’ll warn you it’s not the easiest to find, but if you’re walking through the dino’s you’re in the right direction.</p>
	<img src="/images/nypltree.jpg" alt="NYPL Tree" />
	<p><b>New York Public Library Tree.</b> Checking this one out was inspired by good ol’ Instagram. It looked beautiful in pictures and I love the Mid-Manhattan branch. Would definitely check this out but wouldn’t go out of my way to do it. If you’re around Bryant Park definitely take the extra walk over.</p>
	<p>The trees on my list I didn’t get to see include the Metropolitan Museum and Park Avenue. That's what next year is for. By then, there will be more discovered ceremonies.</p>
	<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

	<p>Reading is an activity that has remained dormant in my life for many years. Growing up, I always had stacks of books on the docket to read. I would read in the car on road trips (luckily didn’t get car sick), and relied on the headlights from cars behind me once the sun went down. In college, there was too much going on around me to re-engage in reading. Pharmacy school was the same, and residency thereafter. I always thought it was merely an excuse to be “too busy” to read but now that I’m finished with my official training, I realize there is a lot of be said about being stretched to the limits. Now, I have the autonomy and space to make the choice to read again.</p>
	<p>I’ve finally gotten back into the habit of reading. It’s what I do on the train and a little bit right when I get home so I don’t succumb to the black hole that is evening news until I’ve at least finished an extra chapter. I really enjoy the quiet mindfulness that reading affords me. Since half of this year was taken up by residency, I didn’t think I was able to read that much in 2017; however when I looked at my shelf there were a few I managed to squeeze in, mostly thanks to the New York City move.</p>
	<p>1. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422186431/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1422186431&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=578a078d3d2aa94a845d7bb85f4f8fd2">Leading Change</a> by John Kotter.</b> This was a required reading in seminar for one of my MS courses this year. We read it in sections each week and presented them throughout the semester in a divide-and-conquer approach. This was of particular interest to me because I believe mastering the change process is one of the most important and foundational skills as a leader. This book goes into objective steps to take and mindsets to foster within teams to promote successful and sustaining change.</p>
	<p>2. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298840X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=081298840X&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=c9aa9cb4cd56867f0df164b566115409">When Breath Becomes Air</a> by Paul Kalanithi.</b> This was a requirement in my residency when we had a guest presenter. It was a quick read, able to finish in one sitting. The author provides an incredible story of going from health care professional to patient, and how to come to grips with the reality of how evidence-based medicine applies when you’re facing death. It will change your life forever.</p>
	<p>3. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312430000/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312430000&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=d01ba2ca18dffa9013f2d6fa0c21498a">The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</a> by Atul Gawande.</b> This was a book that was recommended by one of my residency preceptors. I didn’t end up reading it until after residency was over, but it was one that I’m glad I did. It walks us through the value of a simple checklist for the most complex of tasks. After reading this, I’m encouraged to maintain checklists for tasks in my own life.</p>
	<p>4. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352153/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307352153&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=28392165222937cc7dd5b5d8e46fada4">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</a> by Susan Cain.</b> Reading this book was like reading my autobiography. Not only did I learn a lot more about introversion (and extroversion), but I learned the facets of me I thought needed to be “fixed” were actually introvert traits that the dominant culture around me is still trying to figure out how to integrate for success. I will forever refer to parts of this book when explaining parts of my identity and encourage both introverts and extroverts to read it. Introverts, to feel more confident in our own skin; and extroverts, to help be change agents in cultivating strengths of introverts.</p>
	<p>5. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422188612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1422188612&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=4bbf9874e9f167cf2fbe5ac88f01a802">The First 90 Days: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter</a> by Michael Watkins.</b> I’ve talked about this book briefly when I wrote about <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/10-tips-for-orienting-yourself-to-a-new-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orienting to a new job</a> and <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/orienting-yourself-to-a-new-job-90-day-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 90-day orientation update</a>. I read this during my time off between residency and my first job here in New York City. When I went to manager orientation at work, one of the activities was preparing for orientation. I said I read this book and they were so impressed I knew about it. It’s definitely a staple for any career transition.</p>
	<p>6. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062282719/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062282719&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=1cf4fa6a48127ed660261704f6f5ab9d">Bad Feminist: Essays</a> by Roxane Gay.</b> This was my first book written with a focus on feminism and women’s rights. I chose this one out of the many out there after reading the description in my local bookstore, <a href="http://www.bookculture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book Culture</a>. What attracted me was the premise of the writer being a flawed human and flawed feminist, with genuine intentions to fight for what’s right. I love how she can say so much with such few words. And I aspire to embrace my flaws as she does while continuing my quest to fight for what I believe in.</p>
	<p>7. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345408160/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345408160&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=f08cc9205c46cf09bbfebceadb5b73ac">My Life on the Road</a> by Gloria Steinem.</b> This was next on my list of feminist books because I have only recently learned about <a href="http://www.gloriasteinem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gloria Steinem</a> and her impact as an women’s rights organizer. As I delve into history to improve my feminism literacy, she is one of the many essential figures to learn from in order to grow as an informed, balanced, and strong activist. In her latest book, she describes traveling as the essential thread to her resilience, hope, and open-mindedness. This certainly speaks to this Millenial feminist's wanderlust heart.</p>
	<p>8. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006226835X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=006226835X&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=e0d0015a246cb54e6f145dc8c5da7d8b">Yes Please</a> by Amy Poehler</b> (via audiobook). Amy’s book was my first dabble into the audiobook world, and I think it was the perfect choice to do so. It was basically storytime with Amy Poehler. And who doesn’t love that? It was funny, insightful, and had a lot of great guest readers like her parents and Seth Meyers.</p>
	<p>9. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307886271/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307886271&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=d6e3b0f18909fddbe30c640c918ff22a">Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?

This was my last audiobook of the year, and my favorite I think of the three. I related to Anna Kendrick the most and found her wit and humor the most realistic to my age group. I finished this one just in time to watch Pitch Perfect 3.</p>
	<p>I recommend all of the books I read this year. They’ve each served a different purpose in my journey to learn more about myself and the world around me. Now that I’ve learned I can indeed finish a book again, I’m working on my [much longer] list of books for 2018.</p>

	<p>Today, I share my contraceptive journey with you on the one-year anniversary of my intrauterine device  (IUD) and at the end of a year filled with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/trump-birth-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government moving backwards</a> by reducing birth control access and family planning resources for women.</p>
	<h4><b>the why.</b></h4>
	<p>I’ve been one some form of contraception since I was 17 years old (now I’m 28). For many years while I was on my parent’s insurance, I was able to pick up my oral contraceptives (OCP’s) with a low co-pay, and sometimes without any co-pay. Now that I’m on my own insurance, and not having to pay for contraception each month thanks to the IUD, I am even more grateful for prescription/medical benefits. When I think about the women who desire access to family planning and then the government instills beliefs based on religion to prevent this access, I find myself frustrated to say the least. But I also find myself empowered to fight for women to have the same privileges as me. And by the way, having access to family planning should not be a privilege, it is be a right.</p>
	<p>It’s my hope that sharing my journey will inspire others to do the same. By sharing my story, I want other women to know that you’re not alone in their frustrations in finding the right medications and methods. You’re not alone in feeling confused and overwhelmed with all of the options that are out there, and worried you may not be able to afford or even get the resources you need for contraception.</p>
	<p>For my male readers, I hope this gives you some insight into the complexities of what seems simple on the outside. This is not intended to claim that men don’t attempt to understand what women go through, but rather a pragmatic “you just have to be there” approach. Unfortunately, I believe that until biology changes for men to have the same emotional, financial, physical concerns of getting pregnant, empathy has its limitations. Which is a big thing for me to say because I have quite the capacity for empathy. I'll make the bold statement of speaking on behalf of women and say that the way men can help women with family planning is to stay out of our way. And to know that sex isn't just for you.</p>
	<p>We need to raise awareness of the emotional, financial, and physical sacrifices and obstacles women face every day to ensure we have the choice to have children if and when we desire. Women need to feel comfortable discussing sexual health and safe sex practices for ourselves. Here’s my contribution to the conversation.</p>
	<h4><b>physical barrier contraception.</b></h4>
	<p>Condoms, condoms, condoms. The rubber we're taught to apply in high school, and taught in pharmacy school to counsel others to do the same. There’s a lot of pressure from men/boys not to wear them. And when I was a teenager and in my early 20's, I felt guilty that it "didn't feel as good" for guys to wear it. Now that I'm 28, I wish I could teach my younger self to teach these guys a lesson and stop enabling this controlling behavior. But alas, hormones and the need to check off "losing virginity" off the list and desire for companionship, or whatever other fantasy exists of being an "adult", takes over. In time, I decided to take it into my own hands and take oral contraceptives. As  young as I was, I should have been empowered to make stronger stances on their use. But we all learn in one way or another.</p>
	<h4><b>plan b.</b></h4>
	<p>I wonder if there's a survey published to compare the slut-shaming severity between a woman's number of sexual partners vs. number of times a woman has used Plan B. Ladies and gentlemen, I've used this method more than once. I've used it with people I wasn't in a relationship with, and ones that I was. Sometimes I told them so they could split the bill with me, and sometimes I didn't because I didn't want to tell them I wasn't on OCP's at the time. I feel lucky that I became sexually active when Plan B became over the counter and the age of restriction was expanded/lifted.</p>
	<p>The reality is, buying this product isn't fun. The first time, I did it by myself and paced around the pharmacy for what felt life forever before purchasing it. And even then, I couldn't look the pharmacist in the eye. Women should not feel this way when purchasing anything unless it is financial irresponsible or damaging to others. When I think about it, it's amazing that women have been conditioned to feel this way when people purchase guns don't.</p>
	<h4><b>oral hormonal contraception.</b></h4>
	<p>I wasn’t very good at taking these. I set alarms, and would snooze them, and then forget. I would double up a lot. In hindsight, I should have switched to other forms like the patch, depo shot, or Nuvaring but I liked the idea of having the physical act of taking the pill. It wasn’t an easy journey to find my right hormone combination. There were times I thought, “Why do I have to be the one to take this?”, “Why do I have to be the one to pay for this instead of my partner?”, and “I don’t want to take this, but I don’t trust him to do what needs to be done so I want to be in control of it.”</p>
	<p>I went through a total of three different pills before finding the one with the financial, emotional, and physical fit. I also learned how sensitive you can be between generics of the same medicine. As a pharmacist, I found this fascinating. As a woman, I found this extremely frustrating:</p>
	<p>➢ <b>Apri</b>: This one was cash only because I didn’t want to put it on my parent’s insurance at first. It was recommended by the student health clinic in college because it had the cheapest cash price. I used it for multiple months and along the way I found myself not feeling myself. I was feeling sad and crying all the time, to the point where I couldn’t talk myself out of it and wanted to see a therapist. It was then one of my friends suggested it might be my birth control. Also along this timeline, I decided that I was going to get prescriptions with my parent’s insurance to have different options and once I told student health about my symptoms, we tried a different one.</p>
	<p>➢ <b>Lutera</b>: This one did not affect my mood, but it did give me insanely painful cramps during my period. We’re talking crouching in the shower in pain because of my midsection being exposed to cold air. I dealt with it for months thinking it would go away. But it didn’t. So this time I went to my family physician in my hometown.</p>
	<p>➢ <b>Ocella</b>: My family physician was able to identify that the ratio of hormones in the Lutera can cause the symptoms I was experiencing, so he prescribed me Ocella. This was the Goldilocks moment I was waiting for. I had no physical symptoms of cramps, not did I experience the mood changes that were noticeable/unbearable. I was on this one for years, throughout pharmacy school and residency.</p>
	<p>➢ <b>Different generic to Ocella (forgot the name)</b>: In November 2016, my pharmacy changed my Ocella to a different generic with the same hormonal ratio, known as a “generic-to-generic substitution” which is automatically allowed at the pharmacy. I was on it for a few weeks and my mood changed almost immediately. Even in the toughest parts of residency, the change Ocella to a different generic was the saddest I had been in that mentally difficult two years. I was disinterested, hopeless, and my confidence was non-existent. The timing was tough as it was at the start of job-hunting season. Once I got off of this to pursue the IUD (see below), it felt like a ton of weight lifted off my shoulders and dark clouds became replaced with sunlight in my mind.</p>
	<p>The advice I would give is that if you’re feeling different than usual, consider your birth control. I’ve not met a person who found the right fit with the first try. Listen to your body, listen to your mind, and keep yourself accountable by asking questions of any changes to your baseline function.</p>
	<h4><b>intrauterine devices.</b></h4>
	<p>In December, 2016, when I went into clinic for a renewal I told them about my migraines with aura and realized I shouldn’t have been on estrogen-containing contraceptives at all because of the increased risk for stroke. This came at a surprise that shouldn’t have been, which goes to show that even as a pharmacist it’s hard to take care of yourself without the help of others. I was presented with intrauterine device (IUD) options and discussed them with my boyfriend. I wanted to include him in the conversation in order to update him on why the changes were made, and what it would mean for our family planning future. This was the official end of the oral contraceptive pill portion of my contraceptive journey.</p>
	<p>I quickly got an appointment for the <a href="https://www.mirena-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirena ® IUD</a> (a progestin product) and was told to take ibuprofen 800 mg the morning of the outpatient procedure. I followed this, but it was not enough. It was incredibly painful, an internal pain that I’d not experienced before. I clenched my sheets on the clinic bed until it was over. What I also didn’t realize was how painful the cramps would be afterwards. I made it to my car and my boyfriend had to pick me up (we would get my car later that day) as I laid in the back seat in fetal position. I subsequently laid in bed trying not to move for a couple of hours so as to not induce more cramps inadvertently. I recall telling my boyfriend, “I don’t think I ever want kids if it’s worse than this.”</p>
	<p>If you’re considering the IUD, I’m not trying scare you away from it but rather trying to be honest and transparent. As rough as it was, now I know I could have had some muscle relaxants to help with the subsequent cramps so make sure you ask! And now that I’ve had it for one year, I wouldn’t go back to anything else. It’s too easy to forget pills (I proved this multiple times), <a href="https://www.nuvaring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the Nuvaring</a> could fall out, and the <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Depo-Provera</a> intramuscular shot makes you gain weight. I like the idea that the IUD lasts years and is immediately reversible without ingesting hormones. And as a plus, most people stop having their period after ~6 months (this has happened to me, too).</p>
	<p>As another side benefit, going on the IUD is actually what sparked my interest in skin care this year. When I was on OCP’s, my skin was clear. And I knew that if I went off, my breakouts would come back. So as a result, I embarked on a journey to take better care of my skin for long term benefits and a new mindfulness activity.</p>
	<h4><b>family planning resources.</b></h4>
	<p>It doesn’t matter what your political or cultural/religious affiliations are, Planned Parenthood has a ton of great information and resources for women on sexual health topics including abortion, birth control, emergency contraception, cancer, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STI’s), and more. You can learn more about the <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different categories of contraception</a> on the Planned Parenthood website.</p>
	<p>Other resources:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ <a href="https://www.reproductiveaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/contra_choices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Table given to me by a family medicine physician</a>.<br></br>
	➢ <a href="https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=21938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s a link to sign a petition to make your opinion heard</a>.<br></br> 
	➢ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1039914781?mt=8 " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An app called “Spot On”</a> that allows you to track your period and birth control with reminds to stay on top of your birth control method and track your cycle.</p>
	<h4><b>the bottom line.</b></h4>
	<p>A woman’s choice and access to family planning means the choice of family and career. Individual institutions and states are progressing forward with resources like paid family leave, paternity leave, and more. Massachusetts recently became the first state to <a href= "https://www.npr.org/2017/11/20/565430858/massachusetts-set-to-approve-law-protecting-access-to-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guarantee free access to birth control</a> for all. But until ALL women have the choices they need, the decision between family and career (and as a result, financial independence) will continue to be a gap in this country.</p>
	<p>It’s not easy to make these choices with or without government- and culture-imposed barriers. Why make it harder for women to make independent choices? When will the woman’s body cease to be a political and cultural punching bag? Until I no longer need to ask these questions, I will continue to try and shift the conversation and fight for the women who continue to lose out.</p>

Here’s my latest compilation of microadventures since Volume 3. Some of these were planned, and some where spontaneous.

	<h4><b>snow day in central park.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/snowday.png" alt="Central Park Snow Day" />
	<p>The first snow day of the season, and since my move to New York City, arrived earlier this month. It lasted most of the day and was fluffy, perfect for snow balls I quickly learned. I just as quickly established the Anywhere-But-The-Face Rule. The fluff was also perfect for snowmen and snowwomen (see what I did there?). We recently busted out the GoPro and I was able to record the glorious beauty of Central Park as a winter wonderland. It was better and much more magical than I imagined it would be.</p>
	<img src="/images/teenvogue.jpg" alt="Teen Vogue" />
	<p>Teen Vogue has been transforming its content since the 2016 Presidential Election. It’s “woken up”, as some might describe. I saw on Instagram that one of their final printed publications was guest-edited by Hillary Clinton so I decided to get it for collector’s sake. Upon reading the articles inside I’m so glad I did. There’s even an article written by Roxane Gay! </p>
	<h4><b>glow recipe glow studio warehouse sale.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/glowrecipe.jpg" alt="Glow Recipe" />
	<p>I learned about Glow Recipe for the first time meeting Ingrid Nilson, one of my favorite lifestyle YouTubers and activists. As I mentioned multiple times in this blog already, this came at a perfect time when I was just discovering the addition of certain skincare steps to my regimen. Their pop up shop in Henri Bendel was coming to a close and they hosted a huge blowout sale to celebrate! I’ll post a haul soon, but it was an awesome experience. I was able to get full-size products of sample-size ones I got at Ingrid’s meet up, and then got to try some new products that I was researching in the meantime!</p>
	<h4><b>foodventures at the doughnut project.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/doughnutproject.jpg" alt="Doughnut Project" />
	<p>My boyfriend and I have gotten to a point where we have some of our favorite regular spots in our 10 block radius. Every now and then, we’ll venture to different neighborhoods. One of these times we discovered a place for dessert in Greenwich Village called <a href="http://www.thedoughnutproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Doughnut Project</a>. It had a really cool vibe inside and unique types of doughnuts. We got there too late in the day to have any of the maple bacon bars, but tried Black Gold, Texas Tea (extra dark chocolate with house made dark chocolate cookie crumble and a touch of sea salt); Plain Glaze (Plain Glaze, simple, with a kiss of vanilla); and Lemon Love Letter (Fresh Lemon glaze with a kiss of sea salt and lemon zest) instead. My favorite of the three was the Lemon Love Letter because I don’t have much of a sweet tooth and the lemon was a nice balance to the sweet. I'll definitely go again sometime to try the others when I'm back in that neighborhood.</p>
	<h4><b>classy night at the met opera.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/magicflute.jpg" alt="Magic Flute" />
	<p>It takes a little bit more research and savvy to affordably quench my thirst for classical arts. There are pay-as-you-wish museum entries here and there, and free orchestral performances all the time. The operas and musicals are a bit more scarce for deals that fit my financial limitations. The Metropolitan Opera had a deal for Magic Flute that my boyfriend jumped on! We got a private balcony spot at a discount because of obstructed views, but you can see that we were able to see just fine. It was a great, affordable, classy date night. Just watch out for the uber expensive service fees upon ticket purchase.</p>

	<p>One of my boyfriend’s hometown friends is now in the City studying film and let us know about this event which was conveniently walking distance from our house. The <a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/margaret-mead-film-festival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaret Mead Film Festival</a> is hosted each year to “increase our understanding of the complexity and diversity of the peoples and cultures that populate our planet.” Upon researching the films, Gulîstan, Land of Roses stood out. The description states, “In the mountains of Kurdistan, an all-female military regiment works to keep its territory safe from ISIS.” It was an inspiring documentary about strong women, and what was even more significant was the discussion afterwards with the director. She was able to provide us with even more context with the women featured and updates on their lives now. I’m so excited to check out more of these next year. </p>
	<h4><b>fidi exploration.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/oneworldtrade.jpg" alt="One World Trade" />
	<p>I explored a new neighborhood, the Financial District (apparently FiDi for short) recently when one of my boyfriend’s friends invited us to their place for some grilled burgers. We took the opportunity while we were down there to visit the 9/11 Memorial. It was my first time seeing it in person, and having the chance to be there at night where there were barely any people was pretty surreal. Looking upwards while we were up against the One World Trade Center, it looked as if the building was infinite as it approached the clouds.</p>
	<h4><b>reclaiming our time at strand bookstore.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/reclaimingourtime.jpg" alt="Reclaiming Our Time" />
	<p>I’m not a cool literary person [yet] and just learned about how infamous <a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strand Bookstore</a> is. But thanks to Facebook events seeing how I’ve attended other feminist events, this one popped up for me. It was at the Strand called Reclaiming Our Time, a feminist retrospective of the year in partnership with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_uDLeRN8-s&t=1410s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEN America</a>. I’m on pace to go to one feminist event per month in this city, and I’m really happy about it. This panel was diverse in race, age, and literary genre, with a transcending theme of intersectional empowerment and resistance against the current presidential administration and other evils. Overall it was a great event and I’m really excited to read some of their books:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢ Carmen Maria Machado, whose debut short story collection <b>Her Body and Other Parties</b> is a finalist for the 2017 National Book Award and Kirkus Prize<br></br>
	➢ Min Jin Lee, whose historic novel <b>Pachinko</b> is also a finalist for the 2017 National Book Award<br></br>
	➢ Morgan Jerkins, whose essay collection <b>This Will be My Undoing</b> comes out in January 2018<br></br>

	<p>This year was my first Thanksgiving in New York City. I mentioned in one of the <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/5-things-i-loved-in-november-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">things I loved in November</a> that step ladders were the way to go for viewing. I was able to get a lot of good shots of the balloons, and saw Jimmy Fallon! Below you’ll find my timeline, things I learned, what I would/wouldn’t do again, and other random thoughts about the event. Of note, these are if you plan to view in the along Central Park West before Columbus Circle.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢I woke up ~7AM, layered up (temperature was in the low 40’s Fahrenheit) and arrived to Central Park West at 7:45AM. By this time the street was about 10 rows deep of people and I subsequently went back home to grab the step ladder. Mine was one of three ladders out that day.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢If you’re going to bring a ladder, make sure you go up against a wall or building so the people behind you can see around you.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Bring a coffee with you and get out early. It’ll keep your hands warm and wake you up while you wait.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢No one will be performing right at the start of the parade where I was. The way I saw it was I saw most of the balloons and walked back home in time to watch the performances in front of Macy’s at Herald Square on TV while I thawed.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢You’ll see stadium seats set up along one side of Central Park West. I can’t confirm but I saw in a newsletter that these seats are for Macy’s employees family members and other VIP’s.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Would I do it again? <b>Yes!</b></p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Obviously unless you live here you may not be able to bring a step ladder. One of my co-workers took a train early (~7AM) to 72nd Street Station and got a spot around West 70th St. and Central Park West with good viewing along the street.</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢If you’re mainly interested in the balloons, check out the Upper West Side for viewing. If you want to see the performances, they likely would start closer to Columbus Circle where the parade turns. I was perfectly happy watching the performances from the comfort of my own home.</p>
	<p>I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving! There’s a lot to be grateful for. Next year, maybe better post punctuality will be one for me.</p>

One of the best ways to improve the stigma around HIV/AIDS is to learn about it. Those diagnosed with HIV/AIDS live longer and healthier lives thanks to the advancement of and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART also has been shown to prevent onward transmission of HIV. Today I’ll share important facts about the disease, risk factors for transmission, tests available, and where you can get tested. <a href="/articles/world-aids-day-2017">[Read More]</a></div>, post:

For full details, please see their website directly.</p>
	<p>Those diagnosed with HIV/AIDS live longer and healthier lives thanks to the advancement of and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART also has been shown to prevent onward transmission of HIV. The World Health Organization uses the slogan “Everybody counts,” to advocate for access to safe, effective, quality and affordable HIV services, medicines, and diagnostics for all people who needs them.</p>

	<h4><b>facts to know.</b></h4> 
	<p>➢There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with HIV, and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives.</p>
	<p>➢There were 36.7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016.</p>
	<p>➢As of 2016, 20.9 million people are receiving antiretroviral treatment worldwide.</p>
	<p>➢54% of adults and 43% of children living with HIV are currently receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p>
	<p>➢7 out of 10 pregnant women living with HIV received antiretroviral treatment.</p>
	<p>➢The WHO African Region is the most affected region, with 25.6 million people living with HIV in 2016. The African region also accounts for almost two thirds of the global total of new HIV infections.</p>
	<p>➢Between 2000 and 2016, new HIV infections fell by 39%, and HIV-related deaths fell by one third with 13.1 million lives saved due to ART in the same period. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programs supported by civil society and a range of development partners.</p>
	<h4><b>risk factors.</b></h4> 
	<p>It's important to be aware of the risk factors of being diagnosed with HIV. This helps us take steps to be safe from transmission and transmission of others, while also helping to improve the stigma surrounding HIV. Risk factors include:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢having unprotected anal or vaginal sex;<br></br>
	➢having another sexually transmitted infection such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and bacterial vaginosis;<br></br>
	➢sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting drugs;<br></br>
	➢receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and<br></br>
	➢experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers.</p>
	<h4><b>know your status.</b></h4>
	<p>It is estimated that currently only 70% of people with HIV know their status. The CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. If you have specific risk factors (listed below), the CDC recommends getting tested once per year. </p>
	<p>If you’re concerned about privacy about knowing your status. There are standards to HIV testing services. All HIV testing services must follow the 5 Cs principles recommended by WHO:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢informed Consent<br></br>
	➢Confidentiality<br></br>
	➢Counselling<br></br>
	➢Correct test results<br></br>
	➢Connection (linkage to care, treatment and other services).</p>
	<p>Here's a great website from the CDC where you can search for testing centers by your zip code: <a href="https://gettested.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetTested</a></p>
	<h4><b>types of screening and diagnosis.</b></h4>
	<p>HIV tests are accurate, but do not work immediately after infection. There are three different types of tests:</p>
	<p className="tabbed"><b>➢Nucleic acid tests (NATs).</b> This test looks for the actual virus in the blood. It is costly and not routinely used unless you are high-risk for exposure or showing early symptoms of HIV infection.<br></br>
	<b>➢Antigen/antibody tests.</b> This test looks for both HIV antibodies and antigens (specifically antigen called p24). Tests that detect both antigens and antibodies are recommended in labs.<br></br>
	<b>➢Antibody tests.</b> This test detects the presence of antibodies. Most rapid and home tests are antibody tests.</p>
	<p>There are different <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/laboratorytests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laboratory tests</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/hometests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home tests</a> available. It’s important to use ones that are FDA-approved if you want to do tests at home. Currently, only two tests are FDA-approved: <b>Home Access HIV-1 Test System</b> and <b>OraQuick In-Home HIV Test</b>.</p>
	<h4><b>preventing transmission.</b></h4>
	<p>We can all limit exposure to risk factors for HIV transmission. Considerations include:</p>
	<p className="tabbed">➢Male and female condom use<br></br>
	➢Testing and counselling for HIV and STI’s<br></br>
	➢Linking to tuberculosis care<br></br>
	➢Voluntary medical male circumcision<br></br>
	➢Antiretroviral drug use for prevention<br></br>
	➢Harm reduction for people who inject and use drugs<br></br>
	➢Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV</p>
	<p>Together we can raise awareness and fight stigma about HIV. People diagnosed with HIV/AIDS can live the lives they desire with the proper treatment and self-care. They’re living longer and healthier thanks to advancement in treatments, and their HIV is being treated the same as any other chronic disease.</p>

{id: "5-things-i-loved-in-november-2017", title: <a href="/articles/5-things-i-loved-in-november-2017">5 Things I Loved in November</a>, date: "November 30, 2017", category: "Life", photo: "/images/babyshower.jpg",  description: <div><p>Insert statement about how time flies here. We’ve reached the end of the 11th month of 2017, and it was filled with travel, guests, and celebrations. What were your favorites this November?</p> <a href="/articles/5-things-i-loved-in-november-2017">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
	<div>
	<p>Once again I find myself at the end of another month in awe at how time flies. Each weekend this month was filled with some sort of travel, celebration, or guests visiting from out of town. While it was exhausting, it was a happy exhaustion that was as fulfilling as it was filling (celebrations always equals lots of food).</p>
	<h4><b> baby shower.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/babyshower.jpg" alt="Baby Shower" />
	<p> I have a nephew on the way! My little sister and her boyfriend are having a son and I’m so excited to have a new addition to the family. This month, I traveled home to help host their baby shower themed with whales and sea creatures. It was very Pinterest-esque and fun to be surrounded by old family friends again.</p>
	<h4><b>birthday brunch.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/birthdaybrunch.jpg" alt="Birthday Brunch" />
	<p>My boyfriend’s 29th birthday was this month and we went to our favorite brunch spot, <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/4-considerations-for-picking-weekend-brunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ella Kitchen & Bar</a>. Of course, I had to get the unlimited Mimosa/Bellini/Bloody Mary/Cava special with Smoked Salmon Baked Eggs. This was the perfect start to a great day filled with a stroll through Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum, and <a href="https://westsidecomedyclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Side Comedy Club</a>.</p>
	<h4><b>bad feminist.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/badfeminist.jpg" alt="Bad Feminist" />
	<p>I finished reading my first feminist book this month, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062282719/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062282719&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=1cf4fa6a48127ed660261704f6f5ab9d">Bad Feminist: Essays</a>, and I’m totally inspired to keep reading more about women’s rights (or lack thereof). I also plan to read more of <a href="http://www.roxanegay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roxane Gay</a> in 2018. This book is a collection of some of her already published essays, and has been a great introduction for me to her writing. I also got her to sign my copy at an event here in the City! Her website also has links to her essays in their various websites throughout the internet. One of my favorites, is entitled <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/roxanegay/not-here-to-make-friends-unlikable?utm_term=.cpwjOWR6K5#.wp5wLP1gpD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not Here to Make Friends</a>, on the importance of unlikable female protagonists. After you read that I have no doubts you’ll want to read more.</p>
	<h4><b>unlimited metro passes.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/unlimitedmetropass.jpg" alt="Unlimited Metro Pass" />
	<p>This is a total repeat from my August favorites, but for good reason. Now that I’ve had it for multiple months I’m realizing how much of a relief it is to have. It saves cents per ride but it adds up. And having it be pre-tax through FSA accounts makes it another ~30% savings on top of that. I love not having to worry about re-filling the card and spending extra for a microadventure trip.</p>
	<h4><b>step ladders.</b></h4>
	<img src="/images/stepladder.jpg" alt="Step Ladder" />
	<p>The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is on my New York City Winter Holiday Bucket List, and I was able to do it! Because it was along my home street, I was able to follow through comfortably with my plan to bring a step ladder and see above the crowds. I still got there about an hour before it started, but got a spot against the side of a building so no one behind me would be overshadowed. Highly recommended prop for parade viewing, if possible.</p>
	<p>We’ve officially reached the final month of the year, but before we prepare for 2018 I’m still happy with how great November was. And I’m determined to end this year on a great note.</p>

I’ve got all the info you need to survive and thrive the hustle and bustle of these showcases! <a href="/articles/10-tips-to-navigating-a-pharmacy-residency-fellowship-showcase">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
	<div>
	<img src="/images/residencyshowcase.jpg" alt="Residency Showcase" />
	<p>‘Tis the season for post-graduate planning for pharmacy residency, fellowship, and more. Next week is the <a href="https://midyear17.ashp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASHP Midyear Clinical Meeting</a>, but there are also a number of state-sponsored showcases and other national pharmacy organizations that will begin recruitment this month if they haven’t already.</p>
	<p>The showcase should be primarily for you to gather information. When I mentor others going through showcase preparation, I tell them to be selfish (while not lingering). Get the information you need to make informed decisions. The next steps are expensive and exhausting and you want to be sure you pursue places that are worth your precious time and student budgets. Best of luck with your post-graduate program search!</p>
	<p>The dreaded program showcase is as stressful for the programs as it is for the recruits, I promise. As an introvert, it feels infinitely more exhausting despite my ability to network and work a conversation. With my multiple years of experience both as a student seeking positions and as a recruiter for my own residency program, I’ve got lots of tips to come out with a successful showcase experience.</p>
	<p>1. <b>Do your research.</b> Researching programs is a triple threat. You understand better what you want to get out of programs. You know the questions to ask. You look prepared and interested to the programs you’re speaking with. As beneficial as research is, it’s more punishing if you don’t. Programs don’t like to answer questions that are on their websites because it wastes their time.</p>
	<p>2. <b>Map out your path.</b> This piggy backs off your research. If you know where your programs are, you can make an efficient path from booth to booth. You can also map out where the water fountains and bathrooms are to take breaks.</p>
	<p>3. <b>Do a practice run.</b> If you’re nervous about how to handle your top choice programs, check out a booth that does not have a lot of people and have a conversation with them. This will help ease your stress about what to say, give you practice, and you may also find a new program you never thought you would be interested in!</p>
	<p>4. <b>Figure out your approach. </b>There are multiple ways you can engage in a booth, and it all depends on the situation. There are programs that are less busy so you can see people standing alone. There are also programs that will always look packed. With these it may seem even more intimidating, however what you should look to do is join a group of people already speaking. Find a space within their circle, introduce yourself briefly and ask if you can join (it’s a courtesy question - of course you can!). Listen first to the question being answered, and adjust your questions from there.</p>
	<p>5. <b>Don’t linger.</b> Don’t spend too long in one place. It’s a delicate balance of showing genuine interest in a program without taking time from the program to meet as many recruits as they can. I like to recommend asking <b>one question if part of a group</b>, or <b>up to three questions if one-on-one</b>. These are merely initial structure and you can adapt as you feel appropriate. One sign that a conversation may be ready to conclude is that business cards are pulled out.</p>
	<p>6. <b>Get and give business cards.</b> Take business cards from the people you speak with. It will help you remember the programs you spoke with and be another layer of name recognition for you. Additionally, make sure you provide places you spoke with your own business card so they can remember you when your application comes along.</p>
	<p>7. <b>Keep snacks in your bag.</b> I can’t get anything done if I have low blood sugar. And a lot of times I don’t realize I need it until it’s too late and there’s no food in sight. I keep quick fixes like chocolates but also longer-lasting snacks like granola bars in my bag. These have saved me in a lot of high-adrenaline, stressful, exhausting situations like these showcases.</p>
	<p>8. <b>Drink water.</b> Showcases require a LOT of talking. If you have multiple showcases in a day, or across multiple days, your voice will get hoarse. At the very least it’s incredibly loud and you have to speak over all of the thousands of people speaking in the building. Stay hydrated for your voice and your mind.</p>
	<p>9. <b>Write notes.</b> After each program, find a table to briefly write notes about what you discussed and learned. You could write it on your own notebook, but also on the back of the business cards you received. My preference is the latter because it helps with follow up emails afterwards.</p>
	<p>10. <b>Send follow up emails.</b> This is helpful for next steps. If you decide to pursue a program with an application after the showcase, send a follow up email to the people you spoke with. You can keep it short and sweet, but thank them for their time and that you look forward to the application and interview process. It helps for the program to know you’re interested and have name recognition when your application arrives.</p>
	<p>Those who are recruiting for spaces with their programs want you as much as you want them. Be yourself, take care of yourself, and trust the process.</p>

<p>Since moving to New York City, I’ve found it difficult to pace myself with all the opportunity to things all over the place. And holiday season is no exception. I’m getting Facebook events galore coming through my feed that I’m determined to attend. Here’s a collection of some of them.</p>
<p>1. <b><a href="https://www.macys.com/social/parade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a></b>. The parade starts on West 77th Street and Central Park West and I live right by Central Park West, so this is must-see for me. One of my goals is to bring a step ladder so I can see over the crowds. Then my plan is to go back inside in time to see the performances once they get to Macy’s on 34th Street. Looking at the lineup I’m not as familiar with the performers, but it’s still fun to see all of the school bands and young performers getting their spotlight.</p>
<p>2. <b><a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/whats-happening/2017/11/29/2017-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rockefeller Tree Lighting</a></b>. There’s some nostalgia to this spot because just a year ago, my boyfriend I were here and have a picture enjoying our time in the City. This was before we even knew we were going to move here but it was certainly on the radar as a destination. And now we’re here, which is still such a humbling thought. Another big reason I want this event is for the live performances - specifically <b><a href="http://ptxofficial.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PENTATONIX</a></b>! I’ve been a fan of theirs since they were on The Sing Off and saw them last in Carrboro, NC years ago. Since then, they’ve gotten so successful and I hope I get to see them perform again. For those of you wanting to see the Rockefeller Tree, it will be lit on <b>November 29, 2017</b> and will remain lit and can be viewed until <b>9pm on January 7, 2018</b>.</p>
<p>3. <b><a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2017/11/30/central-park-holiday-lighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Park Tree Lighting</a></b>. This one has a more local feel, at least that’s what I’m hoping. While Central Park is certainly a tourist destination, I don’t think the location within the park for this event or the magnitude of the lights are as magnetic. The website description states, “Meet Santa and friends, watch a live ice carving demonstration, sing carols on the Dana Discovery Center's Plaza, and warm up with hot cocoa and cookies. The event concludes with lighting a flotilla of trees on the Harlem Meer.”</p>
<p>4. <b><a href="http://www.winterseve.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winter’s Eve at Lincoln Square</a></b>. This is another one that I’m guessing is slightly more local, and I say that only because it’s in the Upper West Side. I have no doubts it will be a large event. The description says there will be a tree lighting, entertainment (music, performances, processional groups, jugglers, stilt-walkers, and more), and food tastings for $1-$4.</p>
<p>5. <b><a href="http://bryantpark.org/amenities/bank-of-america-winter-village-at-bryant-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winter Village at Bryant Park</a></b>. ​Bank of America sponsors the Winter Village at Bryant Park is Midtown Manhattan. There’s the Holiday Shops, food, and New York City’s only free admission ice skating rink. Since it’s free to enter but you pay for skate rentals, my plan is to invest in my own pair. I’ve only gone ice skating twice in my life, so I’m excited to do it more often and get a nice workout in (added bonus).</p>
<p>6. <b><a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/dyker-heights-christmas-lights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dyker Heights Christmas Lights</a></b>. One of my work colleagues told me about this place in Brooklyn that I had to see for the most insane residential light show ever. Looking at some pictures, I’d have to agree. I’m excited to fit this one into the schedule!</p>
<p>While there’s no shortage of events you can attend that are paid entry, like seeing The Nutcracker® at Lincoln Square or the Radio City Rockettes, there are plenty of things to do around the city that are free. I’m guessing these events will get get pretty crowded and will have to get there early for good spots, but I’m happy to invest time over money for these exciting experiences.</p>

<p>Today, we’re going to have a coffee break together and chat about identity. This summer, I read this Huffington Post article entitled <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-asian-american-awakening-that-moment-when-you_us_59307537e4b042ffa289e880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Asian-American Awakening: That Moment When You Realize You’re Not White</a> and it sent me on a train of thoughts about my own journey as an Asian-American woman. I don’t have the exact same experience as the writer, but a lot of themes spoke to me. Ingrid Nilsen also has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhjnymqAb0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> that talks about her identity as a Thai+Norwegian woman. She addresses how she didn’t realize she was “different” until she started school and noticed her packed lunch food was different than everyone else’s.</p>
<p>A little about me. I’m Filipina. I haven’t done a 23andMe but I’m pretty sure I’m at minimum 90%. Maybe there’s some Spanish in there from the time they colonized the Philippines. I was also born in the Puerto Rico, which means I am a citizen of the United States of America. Growing up in a beachside town in Florida, I never thought I was in a place that wasn’t diverse. I wasn’t the only Asian in my classes, but still was used to getting questions like, “What are you?” See <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/how-ive-been-asked-about-my-ethnicity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I don’t recall ever really thinking whether I looked different than anyone else, or was treated differently because of my skin color. In reference to the article, it would be an exaggeration to say that I felt “trapped in two worlds”. </p>
<p>That being said, I recognize that I express or hold back certain parts of myself depending on the dominant culture around me, either majority Filipino or non-Filipino. There's even a middle tier of majority Asian/non-Filipino. When I’m around Filipino’s, I can “turn it on”. It’s like riding a bike. I know what to eat, how to eat it. I address my elders as “Ate/Kuya”, or “Tita/Tito”, or “Lola/Lolo”. I greet others by kissing cheeks. </p>
<p>I’m also citizen of the United States of America. If I go to the Philippines now, it is distinctly obvious that I’m a tourist despite looking generally like everyone else. I grew up in the USA and who I am is a direct result of the influence and culture in this country - for better or for worse.</p>
<p>None of this code-switching is an act, but rather an automated assimilation of what is around me. Sometimes I wonder, has it been my choice to do that or am I inherently trying to blend in? And is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>This brings me to where I place myself on the Asian-American spectrum, and whether that even exists. To do that, we explore the ever politically correct stereotypes. With a quick Google search of “Asian stereotypes” an article from the Odyssey was first on the results list. It shares the <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/most-common-asian-stereotypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 most common Asian stereotypes</a>. To summarize: Asians have yellow skin, are all the same, have slanted eyes, are smart, eat dogs, have karate in their genetics, get asked where they’re from, only date other Asians, can’t drive, and always get A’s.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways I don’t adhere to the Asian stereotypes. Whether I agree with the ones listed in the Odyssey article or not, they are stereotypes birthed out of truth from a subset of Asians and perpetuated by media, entertainment, and direct exposure to certain cultures.</p>
<p>There are also a number of stereotypes that do apply to me. However, because I don’t fit into ALL of the stereotypes, I still say things like, “I’m not that Asian”. As if only having 6 out of 10 (for example) of the aforementioned list apply to me puts me at only 60% Asian.</p>
<p>When I first said it to my boyfriend he was confused. I am Filipina. Which is in Asia. He challenged how it could possibly be a spectrum. When explaining why I claim to be “not that” Asian, I describe the traits above where I don’t fit the stereotypes and immediately realized I help perpetuate them by doing that. Talk about some foot-in-mouth syndrome.</p>
<p>His challenge got me asking myself why I say I’m “not that” Asian in the first place. My current theory is that I don’t want to be placed in the stereotype bucket of Asian. And why not? Because I want someone to get to know me as an individual and not a certain way “because of” my Asian-ness. I don’t want the fact that my skin is brown and I’m Asian that you automatically think I’m smart, because you’ll probably be disappointed. I don’t want you to think that I eat only weird (well, weird to some) food and don’t LOVE Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supremes like a true American. I don’t want to have to contradict or confirm anyone’s inherent bias due to my appearance. I want to define who I am on my own terms and let that be known.</p>
<p>It's taken time to find the words to articulate what I've shared so far. As I searched for the words to explain, I also came to mental tools for shifting my approach to the Asian part of my identity. I don’t need to actively push away the stereotypes that apply to me in hopes to deter my other traits from being overlooked. If they are overlooked, that is not my problem - it’s the overlookers’. The bottom line is, I’m Asian. I’m Filipina. I’m American. My identity includes traits from the household I grew up in and the world around me. And that’s okay. In fact, there’s no need to qualify it as okay or not okay - it just IS. I need to stop apologizing (implicitly or explicitly) for my tendencies just because it’s the minority trait. I’m proud of how I was raised and the culture I grew up in, and I’ve never been ashamed of it. Nor do I ever plan to be. As the Huffington Post article proclaims, there is an “Asian-American” blend with its own individualities that does not require betrayal or denial of one part or the other.</p>
<p>When I have kids, I want them to address their elders the way I was raised to. I want them to grow up with the Filipino dishes I grew up with (granted, I should learn how to cook them first). But I also want them to embrace the wonders of being an American and all of its opportunity.</p>
<p>Until that happens, it’s time to live by example.</p>

If you’re curious what’s so great about Millenials, today I’ve got 5 to share. <a href="/articles/power-of-millenials">[Read More]</a></div>, post:

<img src="/images/powerofmillenials.jpg" alt="Power of Millenials" />
<p>There’s a lot of buzz in all industries about “what to do with Millenials”, “how to manage Millenials”, “what industries Millenials are destroying” and frankly I’m tired of the negative attitude other generations have on us. It’s particularly frustrating to be at conferences where there are workshops of leaders discussing how to handle the entitlement of their Millenial employees. While I understand that these maybe purely in the spirit of continuous improvement to host articles and workshops on these topics for current management, the word choices for describing the Millenial generation is almost always negative.</p>
<p>Millenials are of age and training to take leadership roles in the world and be change agents in the workforce and culture of this country. Millenials, at least in the United States, have inherited some tough social and economic environments that we will need to find solutions for but had very little stake in their causes. Healthcare access and affordability, student loan debt, work conditions challenges, and intersectional awareness (or lack thereof). However, as with most situations, it’s not our problems that define us but rather how we respond to them.</p>
<p>As one of the “older” Millenials (circa late 1980's), I’ve come up with this list of traits that I believe make Millenials strong.</p>
<p>1. <b>Seeking purpose over product.</b> There are a lot of <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/02/the-most-desirable-employee-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">articles</a> out there about the demands of Millenials as employees and how we are <a href="https://gobehere.com/millennials-changing-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changing work</a>. We want flexibility in hours, remote work options, and other benefits like healthcare and paid family leave (maternal and paternal). Women are also having <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrealoubier/2017/06/07/how-will-the-future-of-work-affect-women/#1ff12edfc26e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demands</a> that accommodate equality as well as choice to not choose between family and career. We've learned our parents and past generations and understand the need to put food on the table. But with other lessons we've come to know that we have to have fulfilling lives outside of work as well.</p>
<p>2. <b>Social responsibility.</b> I saw an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8/#diamonds-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> about the industries Millenials are <b>killing</b>. Why are Millenials the ones ruining these industries when in the capitalist society we have in the USA, the businesses should adapt to the customer base to stay in business? In addition to products adapting to the Millenial generation, Millenials are also challenging the values of businesses. We pay attention to how industries take care of their customers and employees. We challenge business values that are self-interested and don’t benefit the greater good.</p>
<p>3. <b>Activism.</b> We’ve seen what happens with social/political/cultural complacency. We are living it today and are in the midst of revolution in many ways. Instead of riding the waves, we are making them. We’re waking up with full force and understanding the system to make change from both the inside and the outside. We’re realizing the value of our voice and action to replace those with undeserved and inappropriately leveraged power privilege. We don’t just shout for change but are the agents that implement and optimize change.</p>
<p>4. <b>Innovation.</b> We grew up with the world more accessible than any other generation before us. Since I’m one of the “older” ones, I still remember dial-up (shout out to AOL and NetZero!) and before Apple iPhone (Blackberry girl all the way). But because we’ve grown up in such transformational change in all industries, we understand the value of innovation and challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>5. <b>Adaptability</b>. Millenials have been raised in an environment where the rates of change are exponentially increasing. As a result, we can respond to change and while uncomfortable, we don’t resist it. We embrace it and see it as a challenge to find the solution. We have entrepreneurial spirits that allow us to adapt to situations outside of our control, and create new spaces that we can.</p>
<p>If you believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strauss-Howe generational theory</a>, Millenials are part of the “<a href="http://www.lifecourse.com/about/method/the-four-turnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth turn</a>” and will experience world crisis. With that, we will also be the ones to solve the problems of the world with increasing civic engagement and a re-evaluation of behaviors so the next generation can flourish. I hear in negative tones how Millenials want to travel the world, will leave our jobs if we're not happy with them, and are constantly on our phones. I challenge those statements not for accuracy in content but in tone, and encourage others to think from a different perspective - a more positive one. The world is at our fingertips in ways it never used to be, and with that comes perspective and open-mindedness for others different from ourselves. With the challenges placed upon us by generations before us and desire for progress, Millenials will rise up to lead the charge back in the right direction for generations after us.</p>
<p>I'm proud to be a Millenial and am excited to see what we do over the next few decades.</p>

<p>So much happens in New York City that you say no more than yes to attending what you see being promoted. Some of my favorite things are the spontaneous discoveries after a random walk without destination. But there is plenty of merit to planning to attend large events with the foresight to handle the inevitable crowd. Here’s the latest compilation of some microadventures in the City.</p>
<h4><b>meeting gloria steinem.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/gloriasteinem.jpg" alt="Gloria Steinem" />
<p>I have so much more to say about the <a href="http://www.albertine.com/events/festival-albertine-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Festival Albertine</a> where I got to see Gloria Steinem moderate a panel on the power of language. For now, I will simply share that I got to meet her, hug her, get a picture with her, stand in her presence, and have her sign my copy of her latest book. Life isn’t complete, it’s just getting started.</p>
<h4><b>halloween block party on w 69th st.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/halloweenblockparty.jpg" alt="Halloween Block Party" />
<p>I wondered how kids did their trick-or-treating in the City, and it turns out they do it big! I saw kids all day long trick-or-treating way before the sun went down. They got candy from business shops as well as residents who posted up by their stoops. On West 69th Street they had their annual <a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2017/10/25/halloween-events-on-the-upper-west-side-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">block party</a> where I saw the most amazing decorations I’ve ever seen! My phone just doesn’t do it justice.</p>
<h4><b>foodventures with tapioca.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/tapiocacrepe.jpg" alt="Tapioca Crepe" />
<p>I haven’t been food-venturing as much due to time and financial constraints, but I did try a new spot in our neighborhood because I was curious about this tapioca crepe I always walk by at <a href="http://tapnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tap NYC</a>. The savory crepe I got was pretty filling, and crepe surprisingly crisp. I enjoyed it, but it was a little too expensive for my regular consumption.</p>
<h4><b>meeting ingrid nilsen.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/ingridmeetup.jpg" alt="Ingrid Meet Up" />
<p>Meeting Ingrid Nilsen inspired me try to meeting more people who influence me and others. And New York City is a great place for that! Ingrid is someone I’ve been following on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/missglamorazzi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> for years, since I started watching lifestyle videos. She had a meetup in the City in collaboration with <a href="https://www.glowrecipe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glow Recipe</a> a Korean beauty company with some great products. It was my first time trying Korean skincare and came timely as I’ve begun incorporating more steps into my routine.</p>
<h4><b>hani sidewalk art.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/hanisidewalk.jpg" alt="Hani Sidewalk Art" />
<p>One of my favorite things to do in the City is take a random walk with my boyfriend without destination. One recent walk took us through Central Park and to the Upper East Side. Along the way, we saw this beautiful artwork on the sidewalk. It turns out this artist has done a lot of art on sidewalks throughout the years and has his own <a href="http://www.hanisidewalkart.com/index2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>
<p>Adventures await all of us, if we have the space within ourselves to lean into them. What microadventures have you had lately?</p>

This time period has been filled with uncertainty, building habits, and defining boundaries. Now that it’s been 90 days, did these tips work? Did they help? Read more to find out.</p> <a href="/articles/orienting-yourself-to-a-new-job-90-day-update">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
<div>
<img src="/images/orientationupdate.jpg" alt="Orientation Update" />
<p>When preparing for my first day of work, I read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422188612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1422188612&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=1a2080231fb98fecc14f65a0dead0270">The First 90 Days: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter</a>. It helped me to understand the importance of taking the lessons learned from my prior experiences but not assume they would be all I needed to succeed in the next ones. So I wrote a post that outlined the <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/10-tips-for-orienting-yourself-to-a-new-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 principles I would use</a> to orient myself through the first 90 days. Well, 90 days have now passed. When I reflect on how time flies, I’ve realized how much I learned already and how important my training was. I’ve made choices where I could, and made them for myself. In the beginning, I was immensely uncomfortable with the unknown and feeling like I had so much expected of me but realized it was all in my head and residual stress from residency. Now I’m in more of a routine, I have roles that are unique to my position, and people are realizing it.</p>
<p>All of that being said, how did the 10 principles work out? Let’s explore.</p>
<p>1. <b>Keep an open mind.</b> This has been essential. In the first few weeks on the job I was doing so much comparing of this institution to my previous one. And it was an uncomfortable time for me because I felt like there were so many things to be fixed quickly if I had the decision-making power to make changes. I had to deliberately remove comparative thoughts in my mind, put on my tunnel vision, and focus on my own job and what I could control. In the past 90 days I’ve asked questions regarding context and history and it has afforded me a much better understanding of culture and personalities of my department.</p>
<p>2. <b>What got you here won't get you there.</b> Related to keeping an open mind, I also had to make sure I wasn’t assuming that the skills and resources I had previously could be automatically duplicated and I could hit the ground running. There have been slide decks and document templates I’ve been able to use, modify, and add my institution's logo on to get things done. But the key has been adapting what I know to where I am now, and not cause too many waves for change yet. My time will come and I have enough self awareness and situational awareness to take advantage of the opportunity when the time is right.</p>
<p>3. <b>Focus on building relationships.</b> This has been one of the hardest ones for me to do. I’m an introvert who enjoys my solitude every chance I get. And sometimes I even forcefully create those chances. However, I think that because of this I’ve challenged myself to really consider which people would be most beneficial to have on my side, and also pay it forward where I can. I’ve been able to build relationships both within and outside of my department and gone out of my comfort zone to do so. Each time I’ve put myself out there, I haven’t regretted it, and that encourages me to keep going.</p>
<p>4. <b>Get lost.</b> There were days that I didn’t know where I wanted to go, but I was going outside to find something. Usually it was to find somewhere new to eat. So thanks to Yelp and asking co-workers for suggestions, I’ve been able to find some regular eating spots. But also through exploring I've found a couple of solitude spaces where I now frequent to be away from people to complete my tasks. It’s been glorious, and never have been found if I hadn’t just gotten out of my desk space where I was comfortable.</p>
<p>5. <b>Bring paper and pen.</b> Yes and yes. Any time you are meeting with someone, do this. You may or may not need to write anything down, but it shows preparedness and professionalism. Plus, if you’re bored in a larger meeting where you have no role but to attend, then you can doodle or create to-do lists to stay awake (guilty as charged).</p>
<p>6. <b>Underpromise and overdeliver.</b> I wish I had bumper sticker of this, but I also don’t have a car. This has become what I tell myself with every situation where I think, “Oh I could totally do that!” and want to volunteer for something. I’ve listened more than I’ve spoken, and been strategic on what I take on. So far, so good. There were times I felt like I didn’t have enough to fill my day of work, but I embraced that. And now 90 days in, I’ve been able to take on things that I enjoy and have chosen, and strategic for my career progress. I'm challenged and tired after a full day of work, but in a healthy and sustainable way that's fulfilling and allows me to maintain my boundaries.</p>
<p>7. <b>Trust the process.</b> My boyfriend and I call this the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg21M2zwG9Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“wax on, wax off”</a> principle and remind ourselves of this every time we have to do something for which we don’t understand its purpose at first. This is something I will continue to do until enough time has passed where I believe I have learned enough to try and change the process myself. I have trust and respect for my boss and will believe in how she leads the way.</p>
<p>8. <b>Communicate.</b> Communication is always key. Ask for what you need. And sometimes you need to ask multiple people. If you hear something doesn’t work, ask someone from a different department or area who you’ve seen get or do what you need. This has been helpful in bringing new knowledge to my own teams too. I’ve also been communicative with my boss, but also not overly so. There are things that I have a more detailed awareness of because I have the time for it, but it doesn’t mean I need to get answers and feedback immediately.</p>
<p>9. <b>Build good habits from day 1.</b> This is something that I’ve faltered a bit here and there because sometimes (most times) I just want to buy my lunch instead of pack it. I also didn’t realize how hard it was to consciously build habits when I didn’t know what habits I needed in the first place, so it was honestly a lot of trial and error to see what would stick. With a position like mine where there’s minimal precedent, everything is possible except limitations of technology and policy/laws. Even today I still try new things to see how a task to be optimized but do so by building from the previous trial and error. Now I have some habits and routine, but also know to keep an open mind to change them since I am still learning every day. This doesn’t even just apply to my day-to-day work, but getting ready in the morning, winding down after work, routes to work, etc. And now that the weather is getting colder, I’m realizing the need to incorporate cold weather-related habits as well. Where you can, keep track of the things you’ve tried and why it worked/didn’t work. This can be helpful for others who may be going through something similar to you.</p>
<p>10. <b>Start with the basics.</b> I’ve found the bathroom(s) and received paychecks. I’m good to go!</p>
<p><b>Bonus tips:</b> There are a few other points I’ve learned in addition to the ones above. They may overlap what I’ve already stated but want to at least pull them out separately.</p>
<p>A. <b>Be adaptable.</b> My boss has thanked me for riding the wave of things and being flexible. I think its important to be comfortable with the unknown and go with the flow. It will demonstrate to those around you that you are professional and good to work with.</p>
<p>B. <b>Be strategically assertive.</b> Don’t always wait for what you need to fall into your lap. Take advantage of opportunities that you think might benefit from being proactive. There were some resources I didn’t have that weren’t under control of my boss. But I knew they were needed, so I placed myself in a position to assert myself and be able to secure the resources on my own in a way that also built relationships with other people (ambiguous, but I hope you get the point). After a couple months, since I laid the groundwork from the tips above, I was able to know what I needed and how to get it.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel these guiding principles have been essential as I navigated my first 90 days. Even though 90 days have passed, I still will continue to use these to guide me. I know that I still have a lot more learning to go, but now that I’ve gotten to know my institution well I can focus on my professional development plan, goals for my position, and what my next steps will be.</p>

<p>In my previous post about my <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/my-sephora-vib-sale-skincare-wishlist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIB Sale Skincare Wishlist</a>, I shared that I really won’t be buying any makeup for this sale because I’m really happy with what I’m using at the moment. So instead of sharing what I’ll be buying, here are some of my current favorite products that you can get at Sephora to take advantage of the sale.</p>
<p>1. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/apres-ski-glow-face-palette-P425258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becca Apres Ski Glow Face Palette (0.54 oz, $54)</a>.</b> I got this product right when I saw it featured as a Sneak Peek on Temptalia’s website before her <a href="https://www.temptalia.com/becca-apres-ski-glow-face-palette-review-photos-swatches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a> (which I don’t normally do) because I thought it was such a great value. The only Becca product I had before this was Jaclyn Hill’s Champagne Pop because I thought it would be limited edition (which it’s not now). So I didn’t have any of the cult favorites it seems like everyone has. When I saw the components of this to include cult favorite sand ones I’ve been interested in trying, PLUS a limited edition unique shade I jumped on it. According to the reviews, it’s not the same formula but luckily I don’t have anything except one product to compare it to. I think the colors are beautiful and work well on my skin. Icicle is gorgeous and unique, the Winter Berry blush I’m okay with it being more sheer. So if you’re new to Becca, aren’t a highlighter junkie but curious to try something new, and want an incredible value I would recommend this!</p>
<p>2. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/smashbox-photo-finish-primer-water-P392347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smashbox Photo Finish Primer Water (1 oz, $16 or 3.9 oz, $32)</a>.</b> I got the 1 oz. bottle in a Sephora Favorites box a couple of years ago and didn’t touch it for a long time. I didn’t really believe it would do anything. I went for it one day and really fell in love with it. It is hydrating but once it settles into the skin provides a primed surface for foundation. I haven’t tested a comparison as far as lengthening of my base makeup but can definitely feel a difference in hydration upon application. I also use it to spray my eye brushes to get foiling effects for shimmer/glitter shadows.</p>
<p>3. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/audacious-lipstick-P387906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nars Audacious Lipsticks (0.14 oz, $34)</a>.</b> I only have one color in this formulation: Janet, described as a deep magenta. But it’s hands down my favorite high-end, bullet form lipstick formulation. I have a lot on my wishlist for someday, like Mona, but for the cost I just can’t justify it. It’s incredibly pigmented, comfortable, creamy, and long-lasting. The line is filled with beautiful colors and I wish I could have all of them.</p>
<p>4. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-lip-stain-liquid-lipstick-P281411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sephora Creamy Lip Stains (0.169 oz each, $14)</a>.</b> The ones I have are: Dark Forest #29 (for adventure), Blackberry Sorbet #14 (for deep berry tones), Always Red #1  (for red lip confidence), Marvelous Mauve #13 (lighter mauve for fall) and Vintage Rosewood #14 (for every day nude with medium skin). I love this formula. Love, love love. And honestly, maybe I will in fact get some more colors. The formula applies smoothly and dries to a comfortable matte.</p>
<p>5. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/rise-and-glow-P414671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drunk Elephant Rise + Glow™ Duo (0.27 oz each, $23)</a>.</b> This includes a small bottle of B-Hydra™ Intensive Hydration Gel and C-Firma™ Day Serum. I really like that Drunk Elephant™ has these small sizes to try. In my opinion it shows that they believe in the quality of their products to allow consumers to try them in a smaller size before committing to the full size. I like the hydration gel because it absorbs quickly, but it’s not something I plan to re-purchase. The serum in full size, however, is on my wishlist! There is also the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/nightbright-P414672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NightBright™ Duo</a> that has the Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil and T.L.C. Framboo™ Glycolic Night Serum that I may try in the future, but not now. I’ll work first in incorporating the vitamin C and then move to exfoliating serums.</p>
<p>6. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/metal-palette-P391918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make Up For Ever Metal Palettes (multiple sizes)</a>.</b> These are currently out-of-stock in all sizes. However, if you’re interested you can have the site notify you when it’s back in stock to jump on. I have the 8.5”H x 4.3W x 0.95” D size and love it. It is slim and large and feels very sturdy for travel. Hopefully it will be back this sale, but if not there’s always next sale in 2018!</p>
<p>These are some of my favorite products that you can get at Sephora through the VIB Sale!

At the moment, I’m really comfortable with my makeup collection and am not planning to get anything further. However, I have been learning a lot more about skincare and focusing on my skin’s needs below the makeup. So these are the products I’ve got in my cart!</p> <a href="/articles/my-sephora-vib-sale-skincare-wishlist">[Read More]</a></div>, post:

<p>Sephora rarely has sales, but twice a year they’ll have their VIB sale that is 20% off entire purchase for Rouge and VIB levels, and 15% off for Beauty Insiders (learn more about Sephora’s rewards program <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/about-beauty-insider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> HERE</a></b>). The dates for the sale are as follows:</p>
<p className="tabbed">ROUGE: 11/3-11/6 (USE CODE “20FORROUGE”)<br></br>
VIB: 11/10-11/15 (USE CODE “20FORVIB”)<br></br>
INSIDER: 11/10-11/15 (USE CODE “INSIDER15”)</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m really comfortable with my makeup collection and am not planning to get any makeup at this sale, but I’ll provide my makeup recommendations in a future post. Right now I’m focusing a lot more on skincare, so I only have these kinds of products on my wishlist.</p>
<p>Here are the products I have in my cart right now to hit the Checkout button once the sale comes around for Beauty Insiders like me. Some are favorites that I’m replenishing my stocks, but some are ones I’ve been eyeing for a long time and am considering biting the bullet!</p>
<p>1. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/agave-lip-mask-P384629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask (0.52 oz, $26)</a></b>. This would be my first re-purchase (i.e., second tube) and the first one isn’t quite finished yet but I know I’ll continue to use it. The cost is high but I’ve had this same tube for TWO YEARS now. I use it on the dryest days and overnight as a lip mask. It lasts forever on the lips and is very thick.</p>
<p>2. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-duo-P403736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Black Lip Duo (0.25 oz each, $14)</a></b>. For a long time I forgot about how much I loved this product, and then was reminded of it when I watched another YouTube video on sale recommendations. This product has a delicious mint taste, and the other tube is Asian Pear which I’m excited to try out.</p>
<p>3. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/purity-made-simple-P7109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philosophy Purity Made Simple Cleanser (8 oz, $24)</a></b>. This is another re-purchase. It would be my third bottle since I started using it a few years ago. I used to see this solely as my facewash with my Clarisonic for a long time. Now I use the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and save the Purity for removing my eye makeup and washing my makeup brushes because this product is amazing at removing makeup on everything. I love this product.</p>
<p>4. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/seaberry-moisturizing-face-oil-P374948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil (1.6 oz, $52)</a></b>. This is a new product for me. The air is getting more dry as I embark on my first winter in New York City, so I’m becoming very conscious of my skin’s hydration. I’ve heard so many good things about this through reviews that I’m very seriously considering buying this. It is expensive at first glance, but it is also a large quantity that will last a really long time.</p>
<p>5. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/c-firma-day-serum-P400259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drunk Elephant C-Firma™ Day Serum (1 oz, $80)</a></b>. I recently added the toning step to my skin care routine (I’m still very new to skincare) and keep hearing about the benefits of using daily vitamin C. I’ve also learned that it’s important to invest in Vitamin C that is packaged well because the active ingredient will break down when exposed to light. I’ve got a smaller sample size that I haven’t experienced any reactions to, so I think I’m going to jump on this and give it a fair shot to see how effective it is.</p>
<p>6. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/replacement-brush-head-twin-pack-P256821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarisonic Replacement Brush Head Twin-Pack, Acne Type (2 refills, $44)</a></b>. I keep the same brush head for my Clarisonic Mia 2 longer than is probably recommended… like 6 months or so. So while these are expensive, one purchase per year is not too bad. Side note for anyone interested, in the Spring/Summer my face can handle this for daily use. In the Fall/Winter I use it more on an every other day basis plus when I have a lot of makeup to take off for my second cleanse. </p>
<p>7. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/watermelon-glow-sleeping-mask-P420160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask (2.7 oz, $45)</a></b>. I’m slowly becoming more and more of a fan of <a href="https://www.glowrecipe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glow Recipe</a> fan ever since getting some deluxe samples at their Glow Studio in New York City. I smelled this at their studio and it smells so good. But I’m interested in seeing what it’s like to use this while sleeping. It may be too messy so I might use it as a general face mask.</p>
<p>8. <b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/facial-cotton-P173726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiseido Facial Cotton (165 sheets, $10)</a></b>. I got the smaller package at last year’s sale and have decided to replenish my stocks. I cut them in half to maximize their use. It’s such a soft cotton pad and absorbs products in a way that doesn’t waste product. This is definitely only for skincare; I wouldn’t use it for nail polish removal.</p>
<p>All of these are in my cart right now, so I’m excited to replenish some favorites and try new ones. What’s on your VIB wishlist this year?</p>

{id: "5-things-i-loved-in-october-2017", title: <a href="/articles/5-things-i-loved-in-october-2017">5 Things I Loved in October</a>, date: "October 31, 2017", category: "Life", photo: "/images/halloweendecoruws.jpg",  description: <div><p>The number of hot days and need for window AC units are finally dwindling. The streets are filled with holiday decorations. And routines are starting to come together. Here are 5 things I absolutely loved this October!</p> <a href="/articles/5-things-i-loved-in-october-2017">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
<div>
<p>October still had hot days, but the number of them are dwindling and the consistency of crisp air is increasing. The radiator even came on a few times this month!  It was overall a great October both at work and outside of work. I’ve almost hit the 90 day mark in my new job, am focusing a lot on my skin care as we move to the dry seasons, having microadventures, and enjoying mindfulness weekends. Here are 5 things I loved in the month of October.</p>
<h4><b>halloween on the upper west side.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/halloweendecoruws.jpg" alt="Halloween Decor UWS" />
<p>Halloween was my first holiday since moving to New York City, at least one where people put out major decorations. So far I’m loving the different decorations throughout residential buildings and can’t wait to see what the rest of the holiday season brings!</p>
<h4><b>high school performances at the bandshell.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/hsarts.jpg" alt="HS Arts" />
<p>I’ve been stalking Central Park to make sure I am able to see when the leaves change at their peak. One day, I walked by the <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/naumburg-bandshell.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naumburg Bandshell</a> because I heard music from a distance. When I got there, there was a high school senior jazz band performing! It was such an amazing sight and they were so good. I felt so fulfilled after that concert, and especially loved the spontaneity of finding it.</p>
<h4><b>lemonade fundraiser for puerto rico.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/lemonadefundraiser.jpg" alt="Lemonade Fundraiser" />
<p>My boyfriend and I were walking home from the train station and at our corner there was a lemonade stand up, just like in the movies. It was being staffed by two young girls, looked around 12 years old. They were advertising their drinks, saying “I know it’s cold but the lemonade tastes really good!” to passersby. My boyfriend was determined to get something from these girls and found 50 cents in his pocket. They were raising money for the Puerto Rico disaster relief efforts of the <a href="http://hispanicfederation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC Hispanic Federation</a> and were incredibly excited to have made a sale.</p>
<h4><b>toner step with chemical exfoliant.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/tonerstep.jpg" alt="Toner Step" />
<p>I’ve been focusing so much on my skin care lately, and it’s like a brand new adventure. When I was just getting into makeup, I was doing a lot of studying reading articles about the pros and cons of each step, what products work best for oily skin, color undertones, etc. Now I’m shifting so much focus on my skin care, and added a brand new step to my regimen: toner. I started out with this toner called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0156XE3RQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0156XE3RQ&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=8e18b613b8ae54037329016eef6a6e05">Pixi Glow Tonic</a> which has a chemical exfoliant glycolic acid. Now I’m learning a lot more about the benefits of different types of toners and which to use for what situations. Even in just the few weeks of starting I can tell that my skin is softer and more hydrated, and I don’t feel the need to wear as much foundation as a makeup base. More to come in the next month.</p> 
<h4><b>foodventure with wings.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/buffalowings.jpg" alt="Buffalo Wings" />
<p>I love buffalo wings. I have specific needs in a good wing. It can’t be too hot, but hot enough. It needs to have a vinegar base but not straight up vinegar. It needs to be wet with sauce but still crispy when I bite into it. It basically needs to be perfect. I’ve tried a few different types of wings in my Upper West Side area, and found the ones at Amsterdam Ale House to be the current favorite. Just in the past month I’ve had them 3 times. That’s some dedication.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see what November 2017 has in store. It’s the start of the countdown to the countdown of 25 days of Christmas (thank you Freeform), and I can’t wait!</p>

In today’s post, I share 28 things I would tell my younger self going through these tough times and uncertainty.</p> <a href="/articles/28-things-i-would-tell-my-younger-self">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
<div>
<img src="/images/kindness.jpg" alt="Kindness" />
<p>This post was inspired by Ingrid Nilson’s recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2tejP45Lwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">28 Things I Would Tell My Younger Self</a> and because I actually got to meet her today!!</p>
<p>I think a lot about the transformations that I’ve had in my 20’s. I go back and forth as to whether the beliefs I have now would have come to fruition on their own, but I don’t think they would have with the same level of passion. So as much as the trials and tribulations were difficult, without them I wouldn’t have known my own strength and potential. Nor would my abilities grow and expand to the same levels. I consider these things when I think back to the difficult times in my life and feel proud of how far I’ve come.</p>
<p>Here is my list of 28 things I would tell my younger self (28 things for my age, get it?):</p>
<p>1. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t get straight A’s. In fact, you probably should get bad grades sooner rather than later so you know how to recover in a more sheltered environment.</p>
<p>2. Don’t let anyone tell you what to wear, that they prefer short hair, or not to wear nail polish.</p>
<p>3. Be on your own timeline. Only rush if you will truly be late.</p>
<p>4. Embrace your ambition, but also embrace boundaries.</p>
<p>5. Your butt is beautiful. Period.</p>
<p>6. Your lips are not too big. Wear those bold lip colors and don’t think twice.</p>
<p>7. If the only reason you can think of doing something is “it’s just what people do”, or someone tells you “because you should”, take a step back and make the choice for yourself.</p>
<p>8. When someone says “I don’t have time for it,” more often than not it means it’s low on his/her priority list. Either find someone else or have the conversation about priorities.</p>
<p>9. There are people out there for you who will love your quirks and not tell you to change. You probably already know some - stick to those people.</p>
<p>10. If you have to ask yourself, “What kind of person are you to think that’s okay?” then run. Run quickly.</p>
<p>11. Bathroom stalls are a great place to take a mental break from crowds and during conference breaks when you’re dreading small talk at the group tables.</p>
<p>12. You’re an introvert. That doesn’t mean you’re shy. It’s why you can give presentations to hundreds of people and chat with anyone for a long period of time, but then want to curl into the blankets alone for days afterwards.</p>
<p>13. Start saving money. Now. And don’t touch it.</p>
<p>14. Get high quality shoes that are comfortable, even if it’s more expensive.</p>
<p>15. Go to the dentist to get your teeth cleaned, floss daily, and use mouthwash.</p>
<p>16. Become financially literate and work towards financial independence. Learn about investments, retirement plans, credit scores, accounting, and revenue generation.</p>
<p>17. Don’t compare yourself to someone’s highlight reel.</p>
<p>18. Try something at least once. You’re regret it more if you don’t try.</p>
<p>19. If you don’t know the answer, say so and be willing to learn.</p>
<p>20. Sit at the table without asking. And if someone tells you that you can sit at the table, don’t ask where - just sit.</p>
<p>21. When someone gives you a compliment, say, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>22. You can be grateful for what others have done to help you while also being extremely proud of how hard you worked to get where you are.</p>
<p>23. If you understand your emotions, they can’t control you.</p>
<p>24. Give your love to others because you love them and they deserve it, not because they feel entitled to it.</p>
<p>25. Before you move in with someone, agree on these things: what temperature to keep the thermostat, and whether you hand wash dishes or use the dishwasher.</p>
<p>26. You decide what defines you.</p>
<p>27. Pay it forward whenever you can. You will always be better for it.</p>
<p>28. Lean in to every opportunity to learn, take a risk, and be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s a lot we can learn from those more seasoned than us. If you could tell your younger self anything, what would it be?</p>

While I’ve had these kinds of relationships with people (and learned to create boundaries with them), the female friends I do have are my closest ones. Here’s my quality vs. quantity how to: be friends with other women. Hint: It's very similar to being a good friend overall.</p> <a href="/articles/how-to-be-friends-with-women">[Read More]</a></div>, post:
<div>
<img src="/images/femalefriends.jpg" alt="Female Friends" />
<p>This post was inspired by a chapter essay in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006269569X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=006269569X&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=9fd2dd2f91510703e3c575148d3ba433">Bad Feminist</a>, by Roxanne Gay which I have just started reading and find myself wanting a longer train commute to work to get through more. You’ll hear a lot more posts about this book especially as I work my way through it.</p>
<p>In one of her chapters to kick off the section on gender and sexuality, she provides a witty and honest list of how to be friends with other women. It starts off by stating you <b>“abandon the cultural myth that all female friendships must be bitchy, toxic, or competitive”</b>, which is so true. Upon reflection, I am in the bucket of women who say “I have more male friends than female friends” as if it’s a point of pride or not wanting to identify as the “type” of woman who is only around other women(?). I recognize I need to work on this.</p>
<p>However, the female friends I do have are my closest friends. I love them, we have fun together, when we re-unite (since we are all in different cities/states now) it’s like no time has passed, and they’ve supported me through everything. Here’s my quality vs. quantity how to: be friends with other women!</p>
<p>1. If your girl friends have Significant Others, make plans both with and without Sig O’s. Having girl only time is healthy to cultivate your friendship with them while also maintaining your individual identities.</p>
<p>2. If you don’t like her Sig O and you don’t think that you can be around him/her after giving it a fair number of chances, be open about it and say that you need to create a boundary around that component of her life. And of course, you’ll be there for her through the ups and potential downs in that relationship!</p>
<p>3. Don’t compete with her. There’s enough awesome to go around and we must expand our awesomeness outward but not over our fellow women.</p>
<p>4. Don’t speak badly about her or gossip behind her back. It will come around, and make you look bad too.</p>
<p>5. Don’t make assumptions. Have open communication about intent and perception that is timely and done in a safe space. <b>Pro tip:</b> this goes for everyone else in your life.</p>
<p>6. Don’t let conflict fester. This applies extra if you’re roommates. <b>Pro tip:</b> agree on the temperature settings before you move in together.</p>
<p>7. Call her out if she’s not being her best self, but don’t judge. Instead, empower her and guide her to where she wants to be. <b>Pro tip:</b> don’t assume where you want to be is where she wants to be.</p>
<p>Real talk, a lot of these are tips for being a good person and friend overall. The bottom line is, being friends with women may seem more complicated because women are complicated. But when you find friends that respect you and help you navigate the crazy thing called life, it’s an amazing thing. And not just because they’re women.</p>

<p>Before you read on, I want to emphasize that your health is your choice based on informed and shared decision-making between you and your healthcare team. I am a healthcare professional and practice as a pharmacist licensed in two states. This post is an avenue to introduce you to information and urge you to remain aware and engaged of your personal health.</p>
<p><b>Now, let’s talk about breasts!</b></p>
<p><iframe title="USA TODAY - Embed Player" width="540" height="304" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="//www.usatoday.com/videos/embed/106118284/?fullsite=true"></iframe></p>
<p>1. <b>General facts.</b></p>
<p className="tabbed">• Cancer occurs when cells grow out of control. Breast cancer is one example where these cells originate in the breast. It can start from different parts of the breast, but most begin in the ducts that carry milk in to the nipple. Some will also start in the glands that make breast milk.<br></br>
• Breast cancer is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most common type of cancer among women</a> of all races and Hispanic origin populations.<br></br>
• Breast cancer is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic women</a>; and second among white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.<br></br>
• A clinical breast exam performed by a health professional is <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-american-cancer-society-new-breast-cancer-screening-guideline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer recommended by the American Cancer Society</a>. Mammographies have improved over time and combined with women’s awareness with self breast exams, the few studies that exist suggest the clinical breast exam contributes very little to detection. Keep up the awareness, everyone!<br></br>
• Insurance coverage is usually linked to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening recommendations. Check your insurance provider to determine at what age your mammograms are covered.</p>
<p>2. <b>Know thy breasts.</b></p>
<p>Performing a breast self-exam is encouraged monthly. It is important to do so in order to be able to detect changes in your breasts and consult your healthcare professional. The self-exam should be performed in the shower, in front of a mirror, or lying down. You can find instructions on how to perform a breast self-exam <a href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-self-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>3. <b>Screening recommendations.</b></p>
<p>The American Cancer Society recommend the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/cancer-screening-guidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following screening guidelines for most adults:</a></p>
<p className="tabbed">• <b>Women ages 40 to 44</b> should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x-rays of the breast) if they wish to do so.<br></br>
• <b>Women ages 45 to 54</b> should get mammograms every year.<br></br>
• <b>Women ages 55 and older</b> should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening.<br></br>
• <b>ALL women</b> should be familiar with the known benefits, limitations, and potential harms linked to breast cancer screening.<br></br>
• Screening should continue as long as a women is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer.<br></br></p>
<p>It is important to understand that organizations may have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/pdf/BreastCancerScreeningGuidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different recommendations</a>. I encourage you to understand what your healthcare professional follows as well as your health benefits coverage.</p>
<p>4. <b>What exams are done for screening?</b></p>
<p className="tabbed">• <b>Mammogram.</b> X-ray picture of the breast. It is read by a radiologist to assess for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. Some tips include not wearing deodorant, perfume, or powder on the day of your mammogram as these products may show up as white spots on the X-ray. Also, some women prefer to wear a top with a skirt or pants instead of a dress because you will need to undress from your waste up for the mammogram.<br></br>
• <b>Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</b> A test that uses magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the breast. Some women may be screened with MRI’s along with mammograms because of family history, genetic tendency, or other certain factors.<br></br></p>
<p>5. <b>What are the warning signs of breast cancer?</b></p>
<p>CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/pdf/BreastCancerFactSheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning signs</a> of breast cancer include:</p>
<p className="tabbed">• New lump in the breast or underarm (armpit)<br></br>
• Thickening or swelling of part of the breast<br></br>
• Irritation or dimpling of breast skin<br></br>
• Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast<br></br>
• Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area<br></br>
• Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood<br></br>
• Any change in the size or the shape of the breast<br></br>
• Pain in the breast<br></br></p>
<p>6. <b>How can I afford to get screened?</b></p>
<p>You can get screened for breast cancer at a clinic, hospital, or doctor’s office. Most health insurance plans are required to cover mammograms beginning at age 40 with no out-of-pocket cost. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also offers free or low-cost mammograms if you meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood health centers also provides breast exams and mammogram referrals. Search for a health center near you <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a> or call 1-800-230-PLAN for care today.</p>
<p>7. <b>Where can I donate?</b></p>
<p>It’s important to know the organization you donate to and what they do with your generous donations. One site to use when scouting where to donate is <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charity Watch</a>. Highly rated organizations according to Charity Watch include <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/breast-cancer-research-foundation/117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breast Cancer Research Foundation</a> (A+ rating), <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/national-breast-cancer-coalition-fund/139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund</a> (A rating), and <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/breast-cancer-prevention-partners/114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breast Cancer Prevention Partners</a> [formerly Breast Cancer Fund] (A- rating). These focus specifically on breast cancer prevention and research.</p>
<p>Charity Navigator is another system that uses star ratings to evaluate how efficiently a charity uses your donations. The highest rating is four stars. Four star-rated organizations from this system include <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Breast Cancer Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=11077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynn Sage Cancer Research Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I chose to donate by also supporting a YouTube Beauty Influencer whose grandmother died of breast cancer. KathleenLights launched her own nail polish line, <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KL Polish</a> last year and this month she released a limited edition nail polish, <a href="https://www.klpolish.com/products/mami-martha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mami Martha</a> where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT27F1zfItM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100% of profits</a> go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. I’ve been wearing this color to show my support for research of treatments to fight cancer.</p>

<img src="/images/ethnicity.jpg" alt="Ethnicity" />
<p>I currently live in the most diverse city in the world, New York City, where there are <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/population-facts.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 200 languages spoken among the five boroughs</a>. Growing up in Central Florida, I never thought I was different from anyone else. Yet, a lot of times I get asked certain questions to confirm that I am Filipina-American. I almost come to expect it when I see someone do a double take in the corner of my eye or stare at me as if they’re trying to figure it out. My complexion and facial features can be confused as any type of Pacific Islander, certain Asian countries (depending on where I am), and hispanic.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked in many ways that demonstrate to me a person’s cultural understanding of appropriateness. When I lived in North Carolina, I got a lot of questions because I was the minority. I’d been considered “exotic” from some, and even been “hola’d” by older Caucasian men. And some simply made me think “bless your heart,” with their inquiries. Here’s a sampling of a few examples:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>What are you?</b> My gut reaction is to say, “Human, just like you.” But generally I will pause and ask for clarification.<br></br>
2. <b>Where are you from?</b> Again, my gut reaction is to say, “The United States of America.” But instead, I say “Florida,” even if I know what he/she is really trying to get at.<br></br>
3. <b>But where are you FROM, from?</b> This is the common follow-up question when I answer the previous question.<br></br> 
4. <b>But like… where are your ancestors from?</b> This is one I got while I lived in North Carolina.<br></br></p>
<p>When I was younger, I would answer “I’m Filipina,” to these questions because I knew what the intent of the questions were. Now, I take the opportunity to teach others by clarifying with the appropriate way to ask the question. Generally speaking, if you are inquiring to know what country other than the United States of America that a person identifies with, you are asking for their <b>ethnicity</b>. If you want to know where they have their citizenship, ask about <b>nationality</b>. </p>
<p>Here are some basic definitions to help navigate the conversation:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Race.</b> Refers to the appearance of a person, including the color of his/her skin<br></br>
2. <b>Nationality.</b> Refers to the place where a person was born and/or holds citizenship<br></br>
3. <b>Ethnicity.</b> Based on a group that is generally based on similar traits such as a common language, common heritage, and cultural similarities within the group<br></br>
4. <b>Culture.</b> Set of values, conventions, or social practices associated with a particular racial, religious, or social group<br></br></p>
<p>It’s a wonderful thing when the diversity of a population is embraced. We learn from each other and recognize strengths in others where we have weakness and capitalize on teamwork for the greater good. When you ask about someone’s ethnicity, follow up with questions about their culture and take the opportunity to broaden your horizons and understand their perspectives. Start a conversation, don’t just say, “I knew it!” and move along. We can all benefit from learning more about each other.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it is about wearing a red lipstick making me feel more confident. It wasn’t always easy for me to wear it, and honestly I still think a few times before I actually commit to putting it on. But once I do, I never regret it. Whenever someone is wearing a red lipstick, your eyes immediately are drawn to it. And with the right tone and shade, your teeth even look whiter. I’ve tried a lot of different brands and formulas at this point and have some preferred characteristics. The bottom line is you figure out what tone and formula works best for you, take a deep breath, and rock the red.</p>
<p>Here is my collection of red lip products for medium skin. For skin color reference, my foundations are Maybelline Fit Me Matte & Poreless in Natural Tan (320) and Revlon Colorstay in Toast (370).</p>
<img src="/images/nyxcombo.jpeg" alt="Nyx Combo" />
<p><b><a href="http://www.ulta.com/lipstick-retro-matte?productId=xlsImpprod15921178#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nyx Slim Lip Pencil in Hot Red</a>.</b> For liner, I like the Nyx brand. It’s affordable and because I don’t wear red lipstick every day, I value that in a liner. It’s also creamy but long-wearing. I usually line my lips when I’m using a liquid lipstick because I’m not great yet at applying those (practice makes perfect).</p>
<img src="/images/esteecombo.jpg" alt="Estee Combo" />
<p><b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JG7Y6NU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00JG7Y6NU&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=117cbb893d5f13d56754d616b09bc1a3">Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick, Red Ego</a>.</b> Estee Lauder is a high-end department store brand that I started exploring first because my mom took me to the counter to get color-matched. This was before I knew how to navigate my way through Sephora and Ulta, and didn’t feel confident in myself to even get a bold color. So I took a risk with this one, my first real lipstick. This was the lipstick that I bought after ending the previously mentioned relationship and decided that I was going to start making my own decisions of what I should and shouldn’t put on my face. This red is bold and deep, and the formulation is creamy and very comfortable.</p>
<img src="/images/maccombo.jpeg" alt="Mac Combo" />
<p><b><a href="http://www.ulta.com/lipstick-retro-matte?productId=xlsImpprod15921178#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac Ruby Woo</a>.</b> After getting the Estee Lauder Red Ego, I was hooked on red. In my beauty literacy-building days (let’s face it, i’m still in that phase), I read how this was THE red to have. Its blue tones made your teeth white and it lasted all day. So This was the second one I ever purchased. It definitely tugs and pulls on your lips and requires a touch of patience to put on. But once it’s on, it’s not going anywhere. Tip: Exfoliate and hydrate your lips before putting this one on as it is pretty drying.</p>
<img src="/images/ofracombo.jpeg" alt="Ofra Combo" />
<p><b><a href="http://www.ulta.com/long-lasting-liquid-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod15931207&sku=2511377&_requestid=1688165#
" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ofra Venice</a>.</b>Ofra makes one of my favorite liquid lipstick formulations. It’s mousse-like texture dries down extremely comfortably (Warning: not transfer-proof). This shade is more on the orange side, which is perfect for spring and summer seasons.</p>
<img src="/images/sephoracombo.jpeg" alt="Sephora Combo" />
<p><b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-lip-stain-liquid-lipstick-P281411?skuId=1296060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sephora Creamy Matte Lipstick in Always Red</a>.</b> I tried out this formulation in another color and it’s AMAZING. I want all of the colors someday. But I also heard amazing things about the shade of red in this line. It’s perfect. I would consider it to be the same red as Ruby Woo, but in a liquid lipstick and TRANSFER-PROOF formulation. If I had to pick one red to keep from my whole collection, it would be this one.</p>
<img src="/images/narscombo.jpeg" alt="Nars Combo" />
<p><b><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-lip-stain-liquid-lipstick-P281411?skuId=1296060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nars Velvet Lip Glide in Le Palace</a>.</b> If you love the Audacious Lipstick line (who doesn’t, really?) then you’ll love their liquid lipstick line. It’s the Audacious Lipstick liquified and poured into a bottle. This shade is a beautiful, comfortable, and creamy formulation that leaves a shiny finish and isn’t drying. Side note, this transfers.</p>
<p>I hope these give you some ideas of red lips that you can rock for medium skin. Don’t be afraid to go bold and wear these colors any time of year. I pair these reds with a basic black eyeliner and loaded up mascara and walk out the door. Be confident in red - trust me, you’ll look great.</p>

<img src="/images/literacyvol1.jpg" alt="Literacy Roundup Vol. 1" />
<p>Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images</p>
<p>It’s been a big week in political events of this country and things I’ve been reading/listening to improve my cultural literacy. These are what I’ve been learning about through podcasts, articles, news, etc. this past week along with some of my brief thoughts around the topics.</p>
<p>1. <b><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556606150/trump-rescinds-obamacare-birth-control-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump rescinds birth control mandate</a>.</b> This week, Trump made it easier for employers to opt out of covering birth control in their health insurance plans for religious reasons, which was previously guaranteed under the Obama presidential era. The claim by Trump is that the administration is leading by example on religious liberty. I couldn’t disagree more. I mentioned in my previous post <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/10-places-to-start-to-improve-your-feminism-literacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introducing topics to improve your feminism literacy</a> that family planning is incredibly important. Women have the most to lose with this rollback. By instilling barriers for women to make decisions on what happens to their bodies in a society without infrastructure to support partum and post-partum maternity care is wrong. Why should our boss make the decision as to whether we can afford family planning? This isn't just going backwards in time but it further develops the divide in opportunity between the rich and poor. Finally, there are <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/7-awesome-benefits-of-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other medical uses</a> of birth control that can improve women’s comfort from periods, hormonal imbalances leading to severe psychological symptoms, and save women’s lives.</p>
<p>2. <b><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556116385/nature-nurture-and-our-evolving-debates-about-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR Hidden Brain: Edge of Gender</a>.</b> I lived in North Carolina when the infamous HB2 (“<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/the-bathroom-bill-that-ate-north-carolina-214944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bathroom Bill</a>”) was passed requiring transgender citizens to use the bathroom that coincides with the sex identified on his/her birth certificate. That was one of the first times I realized there was so much hate towards things that challenge diversity in the South. Don’t get me wrong, I definitely understand the history of hate, but this was the first time I realized how prevalent it still is. This along with other experiences I’ve had sent me on this constant quest to challenge societal gender norms. This podcast was a refreshing, science-based discussion on the nature vs. nurture debate about the gender spectrum. If you listen to podcasts, I highly recommend you listen to this. It took me a few train rides to get through it because it is a bit lengthy, but totally worth it. The biggest takeaways were acknowledging that while there are innate instincts that exist purely from biology and evolution of men and women (nature), a lot of our gender identities are from society (nurture). Things like our upbringing, business marketing, tradition and laws have an affect on how we act and believe we should act based on our outward-appearing gender.</p>
<p>3. <b>Sexual Assault.</b> This is a big one, and there are so many recent events related to it. To name a couple: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/09/07/549250118/betsy-devos-signals-roll-back-of-obama-policies-on-campus-sexual-assault" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Title IX rollback</a>. I have so many thoughts about these but I’ll braindump a few just to get them out there. 1) It’s scary how easy it is for women to be manipulated by men in power because of fear and lack of physical contact. 2) Mental/emotional harassment can have a long-lasting effect on women. We must be able to recognize when it is happening to us and not back down to fight it.</p>
<p>4. <b><a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-deuce/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Deuce</a>.</b> My boyfriend and I have been watching one of the new HBO shows, The Deuce, where <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2017/10/02/maggie-gyllenhaal-changes-her-mind-on-sex-work-after-portraying-a-prostitute-in-the-deuce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as “Candy”, a prostitute and single mother</a>. The show chronicles the rise of pornography and is set in 1970’s New York City - mostly Times Square. Needless to say, 42nd Street was different then than it is now. I find myself challenging a lot of what I thought about sex work after each episode. My instincts are to judge negatively, feel sorry for, and want to save these women. However, what I’m learning is that a woman’s sexuality is incredibly complex. My brain goes in circles when I consider how things like prostitution and pornography can entrap women so strongly yet also be liberating and empowering. Highly recommend you check it out; it’s not for the faint of heart, but speaks such an important message.</p>
<p>5. <b><a href="http://girlsautoclinic.com/shecanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#sheCANics</a>.</b> I just started subscribing to the podcast called Stuff Mom Never Told You and it’s AWESOME. All of them leave me so much more informed about important topics but also get my mind flowing to challenge how things are versus how they could be in the world. One of my favorite ones so far was about <a href="http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/podcasts/women-trades.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women and the Trades</a> starring Patrice Banks, founder of Girls Auto Clinic. It’s an auto shop that provides a safe space for women to get their car maintenance and repair without getting bamboozled by male mechanics that feel women don’t know any better. Unfortunately, I have definitely felt the need to bring a male friend with me to get my car fixed so I don’t get taken advantage of. I always just did it and never considered ways to fix that. But Patrice has created a movement that empowers women to learn more about auto repair, which almost makes me wish I still had a car so I could go to the shop. You can get your nails and hair done while you wait. So genius.</p>
<p>That’s a wrap for this roundup topics that stuck with me this week and my thoughts on them. Every day I feel more and more empowered to improve my literacy on topics so I can speak mindfully and intelligently to those with opposing views. I never want to say (as I have in the past), “I’m not well-versed enough to have an opinion yet” because then I lose my chance to speak my peace and attempt to provide well-rounded perspective to others. I hope these provide you with some resources to help you form your own well-informed opinions and feel empowered to seek change.</p>

<p>This is a small, hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant by my workplace that has become basically weekly tradition to have lunch. Pad thai chicken, soup, and choice of salad or egg roll all for $7.95.

<p>This World Mental Health Day, I’m sharing huge lessons I learned during one of the toughest phases of my life that inspired me to make this blog in the first place: <b>pharmacy residency</b>.</p>
<p>When I started residency there was one thing I knew: I was going to learn a helluva lot about my specialty. What I did NOT realize, and what you can’t know until you’ve gone through it, is how far your mental health gets tested, how far you fall, and how strong you can come out of it with the right support, humility, and will. I will not claim that residency is the hardest thing a person can go through. However, difficulty is relative and individual; what matters is what we learn from it. I also want to emphasize that my support structure of mentors, friends, and family helped to build me back up when I couldn’t see how anything could get better. Lean on your resources, lean on yourself, and lean into the struggle. You’ll be surprised and impressed with what you can handle.</p>
<p>1. <b>Saying no.</b> Starting out, you really want to impress because you’re basically on a constant interview and never want to disappoint. This translates you into any request for your assistance with tasks and projects results in a yes. And it becomes a vicious cycle of doing the extra work you said yes to instead of the minimum requirements and leaves you less essential mental recovery time. Over time I learned that if you know what your values and goals are, it makes prioritizing your activities easier. The first time I said no was over 6 months into the first year. It wasn’t actually a verbal “no” to someone, it was a not volunteering for something I knew I was skillfully capable of. While there are of course many requirements to complete residency, you have choices on what you do in your limited spare time. Be strategic for yourself instead of being a yes-person for everyone else.</p>
<p>2. <b>Seeking and accepting help.</b> This is something so many of us have difficulty with. Personally, I don’t want to burden others with my problems, but there came points in residency when I had no choice. I learned a few things:</p>
<p className="tabbed">a. If someone offers to help, assume it’s because they genuinely want to. If you’re someone who offers help to others, this is a virtue you can recognize in others as well.</p>
<p className="tabbed">b. Once you accept help, you’ll notice that teamwork more often than not gives better results. #synergy</p>
<p className="tabbed">c. Help keeps you humble. You learn more about other people’s abilities and strengths that are different from your own which is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>3. <b>Change.</b> When you have every minute of the day planned and crammed with that never-ending to-do list, the inevitable unpredictable events will happen - especially in healthcare. You have two choices: accept it, or don’t. What I’ve learned is that if you resist change, you lose battles more often. This isn’t to say you need to be a yes-person and follow change blindly, but seek to understand its purpose and contribute to the change’s success.</p>
<p>4. <b>Self-doubt.</b> This one is hard. It’s uncomfortable. It makes me want to hide under my blankets and never come out. It multiplies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imposter syndrome</a>. Here’s what to do: lean into this feeling. It forces you to reflect what it is you’re doubting, and why. This is when I really need to rely on my support system. During one of my worst episodes of self-doubt, one of my residency mentors hugged me for a full minute in her office while I cried on her shoulder. After I let that out, she gave me an assignment. She had me write down 10 things that I liked about myself and was proud of. I could only think of 8, and she filled in the rest for me plus more. It wasn’t an instant fix, but it was the first step to pick myself up brick-by-brick and come out of it with more self-love and empowerment.</p>
<p>5. <b>Failure.</b> In residency (and in life), you will have failures. You will not reach one of your goals you set. You will get bad feedback from preceptors, some of which is non-actionable. You will make mistakes. When this happens, don’t hide from it. Don’t sweep it under the rug and pretend it didn’t happen. Don’t blame others. Instead, self reflect. Recognize what happened and how your actions may have led you there. Acknowledge how it could have been prevented and make it a lesson for your mental toolkit. Because the important truth is, you will fail again.</p>
<p>Despite all of the tough days, the stress, the breakdowns, the self-doubt, the wondering if I could finish; I can honestly say I don’t regret it. Without the experience I wouldn’t have hit walls, break through them, and rebuild a stronger ones. If you’re in a difficult phase of your life where you’re in a tunnel, I hope these can provide you with tools start seeing the light.</p>

<p>When researching some topics for Mental Health Awareness Day I came across the <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/publications/action_plan/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization Mental Health Action Plan</a> and am grateful for it. It impactfully puts into words and actionable objectives to improve mental well-being and recognizes it as a fundamental component of the definition of health. It comes in <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/89966/1/9789241506021_eng.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English</a>, <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/action_plan_2013/bw_version.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B&W (English)</a>, <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/action_plan_2013/fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French</a>, <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/89966/8/9789241506021_ita.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Italian</a>, <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/89966/5/9789241506021_jpn.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese</a>, and <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/97488/1/9789243506029_spa.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish</a>.</p>
<p>The world has a long way to go, but I encourage you to learn more about how to get started: from within. I’m not going to write too much here about what specifically is in this document because you should read it, but it starts by “Setting the Scene” in May 2012 when the 65th World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a resolution (WHA65.4) on the global burden of mental disorders at a country level. An action plan was developed that consists of a comprehensive, multisectoral approach that focuses on “promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, care, and recovery”.</p>
The action plan has four objectives:
<p className="tabbed">1. To strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health<br></br>
2. To provide comprehensive, integrated, and responsive mental health and social care services in community- based settings<br></br>
3. To implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health<br></br>
4. To strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health<br></br></p>
<p>The action plan also relies on six principles and approaches:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. Universal health coverage regardless of age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation<br></br>
2. Human rights<br></br>
3. Evidence-based practice, taking cultural considerations into account<br></br>
4. Life course approach (infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older age)<br></br>
5. Multisectoral approach (health, education, employment, judicial, housing, social, private, etc.)<br></br>
6. Empowerment of persons with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities to be involved in mental health advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, monitoring, research, and evaluation</p>
<p>The document outlines global targets and indicators for a percentage of countries to meet by the year 2020. I HIGHLY recommend you give this a read if you’ve recognized the importance of mental health action and need a place to start. If we complement awareness with action, we can build enough momentum to truly create change.</p>

And when wanting to look and feel polished for the day, chapped lips can get in the way. Cold and dry air of the coming seasons are the biggest culprits, but take control of your lip care today with these essential steps.</p> <a href="/articles/essential-lip-care-strategies-for-fall-and-winter">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/lip-care.jpg" alt="Lip Care" />
<p>Growing up in Florida, I never had issues with chapped lips since it was always humid. Moving to North Carolina and making it through my first fall and winter I had to quickly learn how to deal. I’ve had to run meetings and do presentations feeling insecure about the cracking and peeling of my chapped lips and it’s not fun. Not to mention, the vicious cycle of dryness, scabbing, cracking, peeling can be incredibly painful.</p>
<p>Here are the steps I use to prevent but also treat chapped lips when the air is dry:</p>
<p>1. <b>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.</b> This is key. Drink a lot of water throughout the day, especially when the air is dry. Any subsequent steps you take will simply be a bandaid for the core issue of your body (and skin) being parched.</p>
<p>2. <b>Exfoliate.</b> When I find that I’m in the cycle of scabbing and peeling, the best way to shorten the length of this is to exfoliate. Exfoliating the dead skin and scabs also allows your moisturizing steps to penetrate and heal. I have a jar of <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/face/lips/mint-julips/03057.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lush Lip Scrub in Mint Julips</a> but you can also make your own scrub at home with a <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/turn-lip-balm-into-lip-scrub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sugar/coconut oil cocktail</a>.</p>
<p>3. <b>Lip mask overnight.</b> I keep a jar of Vaseline/petroleum jelly next to my bed and lather up before I fall asleep. It does wonders to create a barrier while I’m sleeping and give my lips time to heal. When you apply, make sure you go beyond the lip area and also apply on the skin around it. Other options you may have around the house include coconut oil and olive oil, but I find that those don’t last overnight so my preference is the thicker Vaseline.</p>
<p>4. <b>Do not lick your lips.</b> When you lick your lips, the evaporation will also pull on what little moisture is in your lips and the skin around it, which worsens the situation especially in the skin around the lip area.</p>
<p>5. <b>Create lip barriers during the day.</b> Prevent the wind and dryness of the environment from having contact with your lips by creating a barrier throughout the day. I’ve found that even having a liquid lipstick on my lips is better than nothing at all when the air is extremely dry, but I generally use a lip balm. My everyday use is a lip balm like the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/agave-lip-mask-P384629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask</a> . It’s expensive, but lasts forever and works really well. Side benefit - it also tastes good!</p>

All of those questions and more are answered here. </p> <a href="/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-getting-the-flu-vaccine">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/flu-vaccine.jpg" alt="CDC Flu Vaccine" />
<p>Photo credit: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) </a></p>
<p>As a pharmacist and healthcare professional, promoting use of vaccinations is a passion of mine. Since I was a student pharmacist I’ve been administering vaccines. Specifically, influenza (flu), herpes zoster, and pneumococcal. In North Carolina a trained and certified pharmacy student can administer certain vaccines under a precepting pharmacist supervision.</p> 
<p> I promoted the flu shot at NC State Fairs, when I worked at CVS, and at many community health fairs throughout my time at school. As I asked passersby about whether they wanted their flu shot, I got a lot of no’s. I would follow up by asking why not in an attempt to dispell any misconceptions about the vaccine. </p>
<p>Here are the most common questions/comments I’ve gotten over the past 6 years, along with my responses that will hopefully empower you to stay up-to-date on all of your vaccines.</p>
<p>1. <b>You’re a pharmacist, you can’t give me my flu shot.</b> Pharmacists are legally authorized in <a href="http://www.immunize.org/laws/pharm.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all 50 states and the District of Columbia</a> to administer vaccines. Which specific vaccine(s) and for what age(s) a pharmacist may administer varies by state, so ask your local pharmacist what he/she can offer you. As the most accessible healthcare professional, pharmacists are well-positioned to at the very least provide you with information regarding your vaccines.</p>
<p>2. <b>I never get sick, do why do I need the flu shot?</b> This can be answered by the concept called <a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herd immunity</a>. When you are getting a vaccine, you’re not just getting it for yourself, but you’re getting it for those with weakened immune systems who cannot get a vaccine (patients with cancer, post-transplant, newborns, etc.) With herd immunity, there is a saturation point where so much of a community is immunized that there is little opportunity for the disease to cause an outbreak. This principle is what has controlled contagious diseases like measles, mumps, polio, etc. that you rarely see in developed populations where vaccines are readily available. I’ve seen patients hospitalized for the flu because their immune systems were not strong enough to fight it. Trust me, at the very least, get the flu shot for them.</p>
<p>3. <b>It’s not even winter yet, why now?</b> Your body will finish creating its defenses, called antibodies, about two weeks after you receive the vaccine. During that time, you are still vulnerable to contract the flu, so it’s important to get the vaccine before peak season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends you get the vaccine <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/consumer/vaccinations.htm#when-vaccinate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by the end of October</a>. Many pharmacies and clinics begin offering the vaccine as early as September, so take advantage of this while you can.</p>
<p>4. <b>What’s the point, when sometimes I get the flu anyway?</b> There are a couple points here. First, it’s possible you contracted the flu while your body was still creating its defense mechanisms after your flu shot (see #3). Second, it’s impossible to know exactly which strain will outbreak each season. The flu shot is a combination of different strains from the prior year’s flu viruses that have the highest likelihood of being this year’s outbreaks. This means it’s possible that the vaccine is not covering the particular strain of flu you had. It is still important to get the vaccine each year because of <b>herd immunity</b> (see #2) and your body can still develop defenses for the strains within the vaccine.</p>
<p>5. <b>What if I’m allergic to eggs?</b> Most flu vaccines are manufactured using egg-based technology. A recent CDC study found the rate of allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to be only <b>1.31 per one million vaccine doses administered</b>. However, studies have shown that persons with a history of egg allergy (hives or otherwise) should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/egg-allergies.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still receive any flu vaccine that is appropriate for your age and health status</a>.</p>
<p>6. <b>Can my kids get the vaccine, too?</b> Yes! It is recommended that children start getting the flu vaccine every year starting at <b>6 months of age and older</b>. You can find a link to flu vaccine recommendations for every age, and what vaccine product is available <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6602a1.htm#T1_down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>You can get more FAQ’s answered for this <b>2017-2018 flu season</b> directly from the <b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website</b> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>It’s important to stay informed for your health and the health of your family and friends. The bottom line is that licensed healthcare professionals and evidence-based science are the strongest tools we have to make recommendations that benefit the health of society as a whole.</p>

But being able to run an efficient meeting is a key skill that optimizes productivity and demonstrates quality leadership. Become an expert by practicing these 10 Commandments of Meeting Management. </p> <a href="/articles/the-10-commandments-of-meeting-management">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/meeting-management.jpg" alt="Meeting Management" />
<p>As a Health-System Pharmacy Administration Resident, one of my longitudinal responsibilities was to run many different meetings. The size and exposure of these meetings ranged from small teams to department-wide, and everything in between. Part of the practice was to ensure we knew the necessary steps and consequences of ineffective meeting management. One of the biggest lessons for me was that ensuring an outcome of a group of people in one room at the same time is indeed a skill that takes practice and refinement.</p>
<p>Running a meeting ineffectively can decrease of morale for participants who feel they have wasted time, and build distrust in you as a leader. In order to avoid these consequences, we’ll discuss what I like to call the 10 Commandments of Meeting Management.</p>
<p>1. <b>Have the right people in the room.</b> Before you have any meeting, you must make sure that you have the people you need to make decisions. Know the purpose of your meeting and what you want to get out of it to understand the necessary stakeholders. Nothing is worse than pulling together a meeting and realizing you don't have a specific person to ensure an initiative can move forward. Keep in mind this may mean you need to reschedule a meeting if an essential team member can't make it. Everyone will appreciate this, and they may use the returned time to work on more internal components to your projects.</p>
<p>2. <b>Start on time.</b> If you're running a meeting, don't be late. In fact, early is on time. Not only does it give you a strong foundation to end on time but it is also respectful for everyone who is in attendance. Factor in time to travel from your previous location and time to set up necessary technology (see #4).</p>
<p>3. <b>Send out an agenda.</b> With that agenda, clarify the goal of the meeting for everyone in attendance. An agenda helps prepare attendees for the meeting, especially if you have others presenting besides yourself. Assign times for each agenda item to make sure you've picked the right length of meeting.</p>
<p>4. <b>Test the technology.</b> Most meetings now have both in-person and remote attendees. Get to the meeting room a few minutes early for set up if you are running a meeting. This may mean leaving your previous meeting early, but is much better for everyone involved not to spend half the allotted time figuring out technology.</p>
<p>5. <b>Designate sometime to take minutes.</b> If it is a small meeting, you can take minutes yourself if you wish, but I always recommend assigning it to someone else if possible. It can be difficult to engage in discussion and follow action items if you are also trying to type minutes.</p>
<p>6. <b>Manage the side conversations and off-agenda discussion.</b> If the discussion does not apply to the whole group or gets non-productive, you must step in as the meeting manager. Methods such as “parking” for the next meeting or discussing offline are essential. Parking refers to putting a topic aside for a separate discussion. It acknowledges the topic as appropriate for further evaluation, but not at the meeting at hand.</p>
<p>7. <b>Have follow up and assigned ownership.</b> By the end of the meeting, each agenda item should have a follow up task and assigned owner. Of note, the decision for an item to be tabled or parked for a later date does count. Action tasks and owners should be documented in the meeting minutes.</p>
<p>8. <b>Summarize action items before leaving the room.</b> You will have minutes, however the verbal reinforcement at the end of a meeting your opportunity to make sure that you and everyone else interpreted follow up items correctly.</p>
<p>9. <b>End on time.</b> This is as paramount as starting on time. Once there are 5-10 minutes left, acknowledge this and transition to discussing follow up items, including agenda points that need to be tabled for the next meeting.</p>
<p>10. <b>Send minutes within 3 business days.</b> The sooner you send minutes, the better because the meeting is still fresh in everyone’s minds. If there are actionable items people may be waiting for the minutes to know the assignments, especially if there were people unable to attend.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, time and productivity are important for everyone. Running an efficient and effective meeting demonstrates quality leadership. As a rule, if you have scheduled a meeting, assume you must be the one to get these things done unless told otherwise. Meetings can be your only opportunity to get key stakeholders in a room to push initiatives forward, and not taking advantage of these can be detrimental to the team. </p>

<p>Happy October, everyone! The air in New York City is crisp and cool, and I’ve busted out my fall/winter clothes in preparation. However, just because a new month feels like a fresh start, Mondays still feel the same. It’s difficult to be motivated and all you want is to stay in bed in your warm blankets.</p>
<p>For years now, I’ve signed up for a motivational text service called Shine that was recommended to me by one of my residency preceptors. How it works:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. Sign up with your phone number <a href="http://www.shinetext.com/?r=88DMj2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. Receive a daily message Monday through Friday. I receive mine ~8:20AM each day.</p>
<p>It’s that easy! Messages include quotes, research-based articles, actionable tools, and more. Here are examples of some of my texts over the past few weekdays.</p>
<img className="cell-phone" src="/images/text-examples.jpg" alt="Text Examples" />
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it, residency was one of the most difficult periods of my life so far and I needed all the help I could get to stay motivated and build resilience. There were days the text was as if Shine knew exactly what I was going through that day. Some messages help validate some of my feelings when I was down but also empowered me to get out of my slumps and take risks.</p>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend adding it to your daily mindfulness routine for happiness and productivity.</p>

But before we get to October, here are my reflections on 5 things I loved in the month of September.</p> <a href="/articles/5-things-i-loved-in-september-2017">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<p>September was a great month, but I must admit it was too hot. I’m so excited to see the leaves change in the City and experience my first fall. Despite the heat, there were a lot of great memories to be made.</p>
<h4><b>friends reunion.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/dallas-reunion.jpg" alt="Dallas Reunion" />
<p>In early September I traveled to Dallas, TX to reunite with my best friends from pharmacy school for the college football season opener between University of Michigan and University of Florida. It was the first reunion of all of us together in two years. I was so excited and happy to be with these ladies again along with our significant others and friends. It was a great group of people in one place and made my heart happy. Even if the Gators lost that day.</p>
<h4><b>blind date with a book.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/blind-date-book.jpg" alt="Blind Date Book" />
<p>There was a festival on Columbus Avenue that my boyfriend and I explored and along the way saw an independent bookstore to explore. Inside were tons of books that I wanted and I love perusing the beautiful book covers. There was a section I saw with a bunch of books that were wrapped in brown paper and saw that it was an activity where you purchase a book based on seeing a list of similar ones. I love the spontaneity of the idea!</p>
<h4><b>kids walking to school.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/school-walks.jpg" alt="School Walks" />
<p>Every morning I head to the train station on the Upper West Side and it’s nothing like how it is south of Central Park. Instead of the hustle and bustle of businessmen and businesswomen in suits with no room on the sidewalks, it’s the hustle of kids going to school. I took this picture because I thought it was so awesome that it was two parents (I’m assuming) taking their child to school. An ode to equal parenting roles.</p>
<h4><b>holo nail polish.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/holo-nails.jpg" alt="Holo Nails" />
<p>I bought some <a href="http://glistenandglow.bigcartel.com/product/glisten-glow-top-coat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glisten and Glow Top Coat</a> because it gets such rave reviews (side note: absolute game changer for nail-drying wait time), but I thought I’d try a holographic nail polish from the brand while I was paying for shipping anyway. So I got this one called Manis in Manhattan because I loved the pictures (and the name). When I put it on and it catches the light, it takes my breath away.</p>
<h4><b>happy hour independence.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/happy-hour-marg.jpg" alt="Margarita" />
<p>I had an evening where I was meeting with an old co-resident who works in the City now too. I went to the place early, ordered a margarita, and had a seat by myself. When I grabbed a chair, I realized this was a significant moment. Years before I would have never thought to go to a restaurant by myself and sit alone in a place that was busting at the seams with people. What it told me was that I had come a long way to reach independence and confidence to do what I wanted. It was a great feeling.</p>

{id: "national-coffee-day-my-caffeine-routine-2017", title: <a href="/articles/national-coffee-day-my-caffeine-routine-2017">National Coffee Day: My Caffeine Routine</a>, date: "September 29, 2017", category: "Wellness", photo: "/images/caffeineroutinepreview.png",  description: <div><p>It’s National Coffee Day! Welcome to my cozy Manhattan coffee shop on the Upper West Side, featuring the star of the show: AeroPress.</p> <a href="/articles/national-coffee-day-my-caffeine-routine-2017">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/about-coffee.jpg" alt="National Coffee Day" />
<p>It’s National Coffee Day! I didn’t know that until the day before when I saw ads for Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc. I started drinking coffee my senior year of high school out of caffeine necessity, not taste enjoyment. The height of my coffee drinking was during a really bad stretch in my second year of residency when I had two Venti-sized coffees in a single day (twice daily dosing). I hope to never get to that point again. Since ending residency, I weaned myself down to one single cup each morning. I only had a few episodes of withdrawal headaches to get me to this point.</p>
<p>Moving to New York City, my boyfriend’s brother and sister-in-law said we needed to ditch the Keurig and get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a>. They pitched the space-saving benefits in preparation for no counter space. We didn’t subscribe to the idea immediately, but I did end up doing research comparing the <a href="https://coffee-brewing-methods.com/coffee-maker/aeropress-vs-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress with a French press</a>. I superficially wanted the French press initially because it looked prettier, but after reading reviews I learned that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a> has quicker brewing and better taste overall.</p>
<img src="/images/aeropress.jpg" alt="AeroPress" />
<p>Pictured above is our cozy Manhattan coffee shop, fully equipped with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a>, electric kettle, Trader Joe’s coffee, and honey. And it’s all that I need to get ready for the day! The night before I’ll make sure the kettle is full and cup is set up so all I have to do in the morning is heat up coffee, go to the bathroom, and by the time I’m done the water is ready to brew. I couldn’t be happier with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=a2319e902e983a73033c2c76052eb6d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AeroPress</a> except that if you want bigger cups to fill. But luckily, it just takes another minute to make another cup.</p>
<p>I haven’t bought a coffee outside of Trader Joe’s replenishments for my home shop in weeks. When I was a resident I got up super early, or at least snoozed too much to have any time to make coffee, and went straight to the hospital half asleep, dropped by the 24-hour Starbucks thinking I was getting a deal with my employee discount. What a waste of money that was when I could have woken up 15 minutes earlier and made my own cup.</p>
<p>When I think back to the days of drinking tons of coffee just to make it through the day, it makes me all the more grateful for the phase of life I’m in now. I have weekends, I can leave my work at the hospital (for the most part), and I can do things I enjoy without feeling guilty. I don’t drink coffee out of necessity, but rather to kickstart my day the right way alongside breakfast and catching up on the morning news. It’s more social than survival, and that makes me happy.</p>

With these, you can start dipping your toes in the water to question societal norms and begin changing the conversation.</p> <a href="/articles/10-places-to-start-to-improve-your-feminism-literacy">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/feminism.jpg" alt="Feminism" />
<p>I’ve mentioned before that I’m pretty new when it comes to feminism. I would say I “woke up” about two years ago, and new things are still becoming evident to me every day. I’ve embarked on the never-ending, ever-evolving journey of feeling self-empowered, and part of this is working on my feminism literacy by opening my eyes to the environment around me. If you’re new to feminism and wanting to find a place to start, this list will help give you a taste. With these, you can start dipping your toes in the water to question societal norms and begin changing the conversation.</p>
<p>1. <b>No trash bins in bathroom stalls.</b> This one just makes me think there wasn’t a woman at the table helping design the bathroom, when there definitely should be. And I also get frustrated that I have to take my tampons outside of the stall and put in a communal trash.</p>
<p>2. <b>Luxury tax on tampons.</b> Just… why? The only reason I (and even <a href="https://youtu.be/8c2Ro54Alkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a>) can think of is that only men were at the table when the tax laws were developed. Just in 2016 alone there was a large movement by states to make changes to this. You can read about those <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/08/the-tampon-tax-explained/?utm_term=.3ba757520b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<iframe width='480' height='290' scrolling='no' title="Tampon Tax" src='https://player.washingtonpost.com/prod/powaEmbed.html?adBar=true&autoinit=true&org=wapo&playthrough=true&uuid=1ba4f204-b5f7-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>3. <b>Dress code.</b> This is one I’ve been thinking a lot about recently after seeing a photo of a protest sign that said “<a href="https://thetab.com/us/2016/06/16/clothes-not-give-consent-16604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My clothes are not my consent</a>.” In high school I remember rules about whether I could wear spaghetti straps and not show any belly skin. In my opinion, these dress codes exist to not distract boys and men who “can’t help but look”. The very principle of this has roots in rape culture, slut-shaming, and body image woes.The concept of dress codes were recently challenged in the US Congress when an antiquated dress code was enforced about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40618356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing shoulders</a>, and some boys have joined to <a href="http://time.com/4829073/boys-skirts-protest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protest</a> in <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dress-code-protest-off-the-shoulder-tops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high schools</a> (this is what I like to see!).</p>
<p>4. <b>Need for paid family leave.</b> I believe this to be one of the largest contributors to gender inequality and institutional fostering of gender roles at a woman’s disadvantage. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</a> requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide job protection for 12 weeks unpaid leave. When I first learned about this through Human Resources Management training in residency, I had to ask again to clarify that it was <b>unpaid</b>. The instructor confirmed I heard correctly. I plan to have an entire post about research from other countries and current US states and large companies that are starting to catch up, but for now I’ll leave this video here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Paid Family Leave" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIllumeably%2Fvideos%2F267142393690868%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>5. <b>Marketing strategies to women.</b> I fully admit that I know when something is marketed to me that I feel a desperate want for, but most certainly don’t need. I’m at a point where I can recognize this and make choices whether to scratch that itch or not. However, in the big picture of things the market strategies create a female identity that automatically leaves each individual to counter and defend a particular market she doesn’t subscribe to. As women, we should be empowered to create our own identities and not be capitalized on by businesses trying to create our story. After all, we are the <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest consumers</a> in the market.</p>
<p>6. <b>Only “his” instead of “his or her”.</b> Whenever I read an article or listen to the TV, I’ve begun noticing every time a statement only has “his” instead of “his or her”. I’d be interested to see a book that wasn’t specifically about a woman that used “her” as the default.</p>
<p>7. <b>Importance of access to contraceptives.</b> Family planning allows women all over the world to make choices about her future. It saddens me that politics, religion, and sexism play a role in depriving women of making these choices on their own. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/melindagates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melinda Gates</a> has become someone I follow to stay informed about the need, especially in developing countries.</p>
<p><iframe title="Contraceptive Access" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmelindagates%2Fvideos%2F10155753603373072%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>8. <b>Changing last names after marriage.</b> I’ve started creating a database in my mind of women who changed their last name, hyphenated, or not changed at all. I’ve spoken with both men and women about what resulted after marriage with mixed responses for the reasoning behind their choices. The bottom line for me is that it should be a decision that is ultimately the woman’s choice.</p>
<p>9. <b>Masculinity.</b> I say a lot that I wish there was a different word for “feminism” because it truly is about challenging societal norms around gender identity as a whole. A lot of what plagues women today is an indirect result of the pressure society puts on men’s masculinity.  One of the biggest challenges for me is that men are (in general) raised to suppress emotion and thus equating emotion as weakness. This translates to men being emotionally unstable and can (in)directly affect treatment of women and also brand an “emotional” woman as weak.</p>
<p><iframe title="Masculinity" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbbctwo%2Fvideos%2F10155359731070659%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>10. <b>Intersectionalism.</b> I started hearing about this “third wave” of feminism being branded as <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/19/feminism-intersectionality-racism-sexism-class/96633750/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intersectional</a> and realized I needed to learn a lot more about it. A very basic understanding can be explained by the fact that women can have more or less disadvantage to find opportunity based a combination of her race, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, religion, economic class, etc. In the big picture of diversity around the world, people have different privilege and disadvantage depending on which intersection you are look into. In order to recognize these intersections we must first understand our own privilege. Then we can begin to disentangle a “woman” from an “African American woman” and from a “Muslim transgender woman”.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be man-bashing or diminish the struggles that men also go through. I simply seek to provide you with a starting place to open your eyes and see some of the most basic and common things that happen right under our noses may in fact be an opportunity to create positive change that benefits everyone. It’s as easy as staying curious, asking questions, and having a conversation.</p>

After attending seminars and reading so much about the art of finding balance, every pursuit almost always lead to feelings of failures and disappointment. I propose we change the conversation to set boundaries instead.</p> <a href="/articles/futile-pursuit-of-balance-set-boundaries-instead">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/boundaries.jpg" alt="Boundaries" />
<p>The constant battle of humans is to find balance in our lives with everything going on. The concept of having balance insinuates that within 24 hours of each day we must equally divide them between the activities we want to accomplish. 8 hours work + 8 hours play + 8 hours sleep. If we polled everyone in the world I would bet that is something less than 1% of the population actually achieves.</p>
<p>After 6 years of post-undergraduate school work, and the past two years as a pharmacy resident I am no stranger to the challenge of finding purpose in work and personal life when one held the keys to the future I need to pay of all of my loans and the other held the key to mental survival. I went through phases of being extremely UN-balanced and without ANY boundaries. I’ve attended seminars and read many articles about the art of finding balance, but the pursuit almost always leads to feelings of failure and disappointment.</p>
<p>Does that mean we are hopeless to never find balance? Are we doomed to lives of either all work or all play (and no sleep)?</p>
<p>Mentorship from those who also found balance a dead end goal has instilled in me the desire to dump the balance and instead set <b>boundaries</b>. Throughout residency I tried to set boundaries instead of balance. Many (MANY) times I failed, but I learned a lot along the way.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Set the boundaries.</b> You can’t ensure boundaries aren’t crossed if you don’t name them. Decide what time you want to turn the email off, when you want to go to bed at night, etc. Have a transparent conversation with your boss, teammates, and family about your boundaries and work with them through it. Embrace that you have needs – everyone does.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Be willing to change the boundaries fluidly.</b> Don’t feel guilty about needing to break your own “rules”. Boundaries are not set in stone, especially since rarely anything in life is. Similar to the first tip, should a change be needed due to current events in your life, keep having having conversation.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Have support structures around you to keep you accountable.</b> Surround yourself with people who enrich and fulfill your life, make you feel empowered to achieve your goals but also keep you in check when you’re falling into your Hobbit hole.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Start small.</b> Like any skill, it takes practice and strength to flex your boundary-setting muscles. Start by setting a boundary that isn’t threatening and incrementally raise the bar to others. For me, I started with not using my phone when I was out on a date with my boyfriend. One of the more challenging ones was not checking my email after 7:00PM.</p>
<p>The key here is to know that there will be times of imbalance in our lives and to make these choices with purpose. Be open and honest with your needs and this will take you far in your pursuit of boundaries.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/fall.jpg" alt="Fall" />
<p>As a Puerto Rican by birth, Floridian by childhood, Filipina by blood, I’m simply not made to love the cold weather. My blood is thinner and my biological thermometer is more sensitive (sounds scientific enough, right?) to any Fahrenheit readings below 75(ish) degrees. I grew up on the beachside of Central Florida, where there was no point in straightening your hair except for a few weeks in January (thank you, humidity), where freeze warnings meant bringing your plants inside overnight, and anything that required me to wear closed-toed shoes meant I was shivering.</p>
<p>That being said, I did live in North Carolina for 6 years as a warm up for New York City. One of the things people who know me are excited about seeing is my reaction to a Northeast winter. But that’s not for a whole season. We still have fall! If you know a Floridian, you’ve seen their wonder at the leaves changing to reds, oranges, and yellows. I still get these feelings 6 years later. But I have come to love a few more things that associate with the crisp, cool fall air that I’m excited to experience in New York City.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Pho.</b> Anyone else with me? I love a huge bowl of pho on a cool day to keep me warm from the inside.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Peacoats.</b> I didn’t own my first peacoat until I moved to North Carolina when I was 22 years old. But now that I have a few I love the style!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Leaves changing in Central Park.</b> As I said before, I still find the leaves changing to be one of the Wonders of the World. And in one of the best parks in the world? ‘Nuff said.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Not melting in the subways.</b> Subways don’t have air conditioning. They are about 50 degrees hotter than whatever temperature it is outside. You can do the math.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Fall makeup/nail polish colors.</b> I’m not one for makeup rules, but the muted warm tones and deep berry colors are some of my favorites to rock out on my lips, eyes, and nails in the fall.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Keeping windows open.</b> In our brownstone apartment, we don’t have central air conditioning. I’m pretty excited to remove our window units to make way for keeping the windows open. Thank you Upper West Side and your cleaner outside air.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Mulled wine.</b>I love making mulled wine. The temperature and spice warmth combined is perfect to cozy up with a movie on the couch. Friends optional.

<p>For the first couple of decades of my life, I didn’t know I was an introvert. I just thought I was quiet and didn’t like crowds. Thinking back, I was always reading a book at Filipino socials, preferring to have one-on-one conversations at house parties, and never wanting to go out to the clubs in college (but I did it anyway). Once I got to pharmacy school I learned a lot more about introversion because of one professor who had all of us take the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myers-Briggs test</a> as a part of learning more about ourselves and how to work in teams.</p>
<p>Taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and reading the description of my results was like reading my biography. It felt like validation for the feelings and needs I’ve had growing up that I didn’t know how to express. This isn’t meant to sound dramatic because I’ve had a happy life and am fortunate to not have been bullied or anything like that, but understanding these things about myself, my introversion, was eye-opening.</p>
<p>Once I identified as an introvert, the journey to owning it and feeling confident about it was a different story. It still took a while for me to say no to certain social gatherings after a long day of class/work. It wasn’t until years later in residency where I reached a point (alongside everyone else) where if I didn’t own my needs, I would mentally break. I’m not saying everyone needs to reach a breaking point to know how to get what you want, but this is how my journey played out.</p>
<p>Now that I’m in my career, living on my own in a new city with my boyfriend, I have a clean slate. This is the first clean slate I’ve had with this newfound confidence and pride in my personality and my needs. If you’re in a similar boat as me and working on your own sense of self, here are six ways I’ve learned to own your introversion.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Understand your needs.</b> It took a while for me to realize that what seemed like quirks are really just facets of my personality and there is NOTHING wrong with it. Things that helped were reading books like Quiet, reading articles about other introverts like Eleanor Roosevelt, Warren Buffet, and Rosa Parks. I also have mentors who are introverts that have gone through a similar journey as me. Essentially, realize you are NOT alone and you are awesome as you are.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Acknowledge how your needs may be perceived.</b> Intention and perception are not always in sync. I’ve been told that I’m unemotional, seem uninterested, and like I’m blowing people off. Now that I understand more about myself, I don’t take offense to this. In fact, now I appreciate the feedback so I can 1) clarify and 2) make some adjustments by adding some explanation with my actions in real time. To the comments that I may seem unemotional/uninterested, I will clarify that I’m thoughtful and like to process before I share opinions. To the comments that I seem like I am blowing people off, I say that I’m actually just really worn out from the day and in order to feel well-rested the next day I need to stay in. The more we can help clarify how we are perceived, the more people will understand you instead of project judgement inappropriately (see #6).</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Be upfront with your needs.</b> Tell people that you’re an introvert and won’t necessarily go to all of the social events with your friends. Don’t apologize for it, be matter-of-fact with explanation (see #2). I’ve found that by doing this, it may inspire others to realize their own needs too.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Balance your relationships (i.e., have extrovert friends).</b> It can be easy for me to go unchecked with my hermit status if left to my own devices. If I surround myself with friends who appreciate my needs but also hold me accountable to getting out of the house, it becomes a much more healthy balance. Because as an introvert, I love my solitude, but I also love my friends and family.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Plan.</b> Being an introvert does not mean you are shy (you can be, of course, but they do not come hand-in-hand). If there is an event where you know you’ll be around a lot of people, have a lot of interactions, publicly speak etc. schedule time afterwards to have your solitary recharge. Take a bathroom break and relax for an extra minute or two. Block time off your calendar for yourself so no one else can book time in your office.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Educate others.</b> 99% of the time when I tell someone I’m an introvert, they’re surprised. Every time this happens, I see it as a perfect chance to advocate for understanding introversion. I explain how I am an introvert and that being an introvert does not mean a person is shy (among other things).</p>
<p>I hope these tips are helpful if you’re like me and feel that so much of social and business success is set up for extrovert success. I believe this balance is shifting little by little, but for the time being take these steps to own it!</p>

<p>When I was in <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/the-5-toughest-mental-health-lessons-from-residency" rel="noopener noreferrer">residency</a>, I worked every third weekend without a compensated day off. This meant 12 days straight of 10-12 hour workdays every third week. When you work weekends, the ones that you don't are essential to mental survival. And now that I’m in a position without working weekends, I’m still not used to the idea of truly being able to turn my brain off work at my own discretion.</p>
<p className="tabbed">[RELATED] <b><a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/the-5-toughest-mental-health-lessons-from-residency" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 5 Toughest Mental Health Lessons from Residency</a></b></p>
<p>Here are 6 things I learned to keep in mind as I headed into a free weekend and prepared for the week ahead.</p>
<p>1. <b>Go to bed and wake up at normal times.</b> Give yourself some liberty of course, but I find that when I succumb to the temptation of staying up late binge-watching Netflix and YouTube, I regret it the next morning. There are two possibilities: I wake up at early anyway because my body is used to it from the work week and am tired all day, or I wake up too late and lose half the day feeling groggy from oversleeping. Do yourself a favor and sleep at a normal time, but at least wake up while the sun is out.</p>
<p>2. <b>When you wake up, get up.</b> There's a lot of temptation to wake up and noodle around. Trust me, I've woken up and stayed in bed for hours and the next thing I know it's past noon and I'm starving because I haven't had breakfast and now I have a headache from caffeine withdrawal. Don't stray too far away from your usual morning routine and in fact supplement it with home-cooked breakfast and coffee with the TV on. The important thing is to get out of bed and don't go back for a while.</p>
<p>3. <b>Prioritize.</b> While you have your morning coffee and catch on the TV shows you missed during the week, write down the list of things you want to do over the weekend, and the things you HAVE to do (not work-related). It sucks to get back to Monday not having done your groceries or bought more toilet paper when you had two free days to do it.</p>
<p>4. <b>Schedule a microadventure.</b> This may require some pre-planning, or you could be totally spontaneous. Since I’ve moved to New York City, I subscribed to <a href="http://bit.ly/2DAOUtR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Skint</a> which is a daily subscription of low-cost and free activities going on in any of the 5 boroughs. I like to use it to get myself out of the house if there’s something I’m interested in. I find <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/taste-of-microadventures-vol-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microadventures</a> a great mindfulness activity and distraction from checking my email.</p>
<p className="tabbed">[RELATED] <b><a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/taste-of-microadventures-vol-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste of Microadventures Vol. 1</a></b></p>
<p>5. <b>Do your self-care activities.</b> This can be whatever you want. The important thing is to do it. If you need some ideas, you can check out my <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/5-ways-to-sunday-self-care-that-doesnt-break-the-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunday Self-Care routine</a>.</p>
<p>6. <b>Unplug.</b> Don't check your email for at least one of the days. I usually pick Saturday so that Sunday evening I can prepare for the week ahead. Practice mindfulness by minimizing your time on the devices and doing things like read a book, play board games, try a new restaurant, take a walk.</p>
<p>I hope these ideas help you maximize the free time you have on a weekend. It’s only 2 days for me, but there is so much I can do that has a huge impact on my resilience and mental health.</p>

<p>We all remember where we were that day. I was in 8th grade and had gotten to school early for a meeting for the Yearbook Club before first period. I did not see the first plane, but I did see the second plane because all of the TV’s in the school turned on immediately. And I remember watching the towers fall. Honestly, that’s all I can remember specifically. I don’t remember what I learned in school that day, or anything else afterwards.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, here’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_for_the_day_of_the_September_11_attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a> to serve as a reminder as we honor the lives who were lost, heroes who saved helped save lives by sacrificing their own, and citizens and leaders who helped rebuild the nation thereafter.</p>
<p>7:59 a.m.: American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:14: United Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and nine crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked over central Massachusetts, turning southwest.</p>
<p>8:20: American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and six crew members, departs 10 minutes late from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:42: United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 with 37 passengers and seven crew members, departs 42 minutes late from Newark International Airport, bound for San Francisco International Airport. Four hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:42–8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked above Albany, New York, about 140 miles north of New York City, turning south.</p>
<p>8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. The aircraft enters the tower intact.</p>
<p>8:50–8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked above southern Ohio, turning to the southeast.</p>
<p>9:03:00: Flight 175 crashes into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away.</p>
<p>9:28: Flight 93 is hijacked above northern Ohio, turning to the southeast.</p>
<p>9:37:46: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of The Pentagon and starts a violent fire.</p>
<p>9:59:00: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes after the impact of Flight 175.</p>
<p>10:03:11: Flight 93 is crashed by its hijackers and passengers, due to fighting in the cockpit 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes and were resisting the hijackers. The 9/11 Commission believed that Flight 93's target was either the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>10:28:22: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 1 hour, 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed.</p>
<p>10:50:19: Five stories of part of the Pentagon collapse due to the fire.</p>
<p>5:20:33 p.m.: 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story building, collapses.</p>
<p>Despite not remembering this timeline minute-by-minute, I remember the feelings I had, of fear and curiosity as to what was happening in the world. As an 8th grader the important things in my life were making sure I practiced enough for my piano lessons and when the next time I would talk to my crush was. I was just exploring things like makeup and hair straightening. Then something so significant happened in the world and I didn’t understand that it would cause a chain of events that would continue to affect my day-to-day now. I didn’t know at the time that I would live in New York City at Ground Zero and get to experience the memorialization of this day 16 years ago.</p>
<p>I learned what terrorism as an 8th grader. There are those around the world who learn what terrorism is before they even learn how to walk. Today, the threat of terrorism still exists but it has also empowered and strengthened the activism against it.</p>
<p>I value perspective and open-mindedness. The older I get, the more I see the definitions of “good” and “bad” are incredibly complex, and may not even exist at all in some cases. After moving from North Carolina to New York City, my eyes have opened further to the value diversity plays in peaceful co-existence. I hope to bask in it now, but wherever I go continue to spread the same beliefs. With diversity of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, comes a beautiful synergy of innovation and strength that the world needs more than ever.</p>

<p>Smoothies are one of my favorite ways to sneak nutrients into my body that I may otherwise not want to have by themselves because of taste, texture, etc. Here are 4 things I add into every smoothie I make that I don’t even notice are there but give me tons of added benefits.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Spinach.</b> I used to hate spinach, but now I love it. I get bags of them for salads, in sandwiches, cooked in pasta, and more. For smoothies, I’ll even use frozen spinach because I get some more bang for my buck that way. Spinach is an awesome source of vitamin K, vitamin A, iron, folate, vitamin B’s, fiber, and more. Pharmacist note: if you’re on warfarin, don’t change your spinach intake without letting your physician know because it may change your INR levels.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Flaxseed.</b> A bag of ground flaxseed lasts so for many smoothies. This is a great source of omega-3 essential fatty acids, fiber, and vitamin B1. Adding this to my morning smoothies definitely gets the intestines moving. One option is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DOKFLYI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DOKFLYI&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=c838e1986c6cf71ab89daf8347e46d5d" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum Essentials Organic Ground Flaxseed, 24 Ounce</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Chia seeds.</b> These are full of antioxidants, fiber, and protein. And they help thicken your smoothie, too! One option is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AQFGL3O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AQFGL3O&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=e9af5418f1a48916678a5bbbef92d5a7" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nutiva Organic Chia Seed, Black, 32 Ounce</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Kefir/Greek yogurt.</b> Kefir looks like milk but it’s so much more. It’s filled with nutrients (protein, calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin D) and probiotics that aid in digestion and the health of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Greek yogurt has similar benefits.</p>
<p>With these I get in a lot of nutrients and fiber I (unfortunately) don't in other meals of the day. I can't taste the difference except with the seeds but it doesn't feel any different than having some strawberries or kiwi. I hope you give these a try!</p>

<p>We all have goals for ourselves but many of us find ourselves unable to achieve them and feel too discouraged to persevere. I’ve been in that boat so many times. Each time I’ve not achieved a goal and reflect as to why, I realize that the reasons for not reaching my goals are not because of our innate skills but rather how we set our goals. Many of us set lofty goals for ourselves assuming setting a goal is all that's needed and the rest will naturally fall into place. “Dream big”, “Reach for the stars!” we hear.</p>
<p>I’m not saying not to reach for the highest heights in ourselves. However, setting goals that are actually achievable is vital for long term resilience and morale to reach the next one. One tool I was taught and now been using throughout my career for yearly evaluations is setting S.M.A.R.T. goals. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Specific.</b> This is the What, Why, and How of your goal.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Measurable.</b> Goals need to be measurable so you know that you have actually accomplished them.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Achievable.</b> You should stretch your limits with your goals but also set them with the appropriate level of knowledge and abilities to achieve them.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Relevant.</b> We can set goals that can be specific, measurable, and achievable, but without a strategic direction for ourselves, then we are treading water.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Time-Based.</b> Setting a timeframe creates a pragmatic sense of urgency between current reality and the goal.</p>
<p>To see the tool used through an example, we'll have one goal said with and without SMART methodology.</p>
<p className="tabbed"><b>Without SMART:</b> Read for pleasure more often.</p>
<p>What books define “reading for pleasure”? How will I know I’ve accomplished this? How many books in what frequency defines “more often”? Let’s try this again.</p>
<p className="tabbed"><b>With SMART:</b> Read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352153/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307352153&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=f67145ea9f2514d0cb2424ffdab01772">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</a> by the end of the September.</p>
<p>Here, you can see I’ve set a specific book and timeframe. Now that I’ve set this, I can figure out my pace to set sub-goals and make sure I’m keeping on track each week.</p>
<p>Once you set your goals, it's important to reflect at the end of each time period. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. What goals did I achieve? Celebrate these!</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. What goals did I not achieve?</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. Of the goals I did not achieve, what progress did I make towards them? Acknowledge and appreciate your progress.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. Of the reasons why a goal did not get accomplished, which reasons were under my own control?</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. Of the reasons that were under my own control, how can I improve for the next time to get closer to my goal?</p>
<p>Achieving our goals is an iterative process. Remember, life is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't beat yourself down if a goal isn't achieved at the exact time you allotted. Instead, see it as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I can’t believe it’s already the end of August. I know I’m in the majority of people feeling this way, but this has been a pretty big month for me with starting my first training-wheels-off job since residency. I’ve been learning to orient myself in a brand new environment and learning a new frontier in my pursuit of work-life integration. As I reflect on the past month before embarking on September, here are five things I loved in August.</p>
<h4><b>roses.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/anniversary-roses.jpg" alt="Anniversary Roses" />
<p>This August was my boyfriend and my two-year dating anniversary! I came home to beautiful roses and it reminded me of the roses he would get me on his walks home in our North Carolina neighborhood. We've had a lot of experiences in the past two years and he's put up with a lot of my stress during residency. Now that I'm into the next phase of my career and our lives in New York City I'm so excited for the future with my best friend.</p>
<h4><b>unlimited metrocard pass.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/metro-card.jpg" alt="MetroCard" />
<p>Once my job started I bought a 30-unlimited <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroCard</a> since I take a train to work every day. I'm grateful for the world of exploration the train opens for me. I'm able to get from one end to Manhattan to another in less than 30 minutes on a direct line and check out different boroughs. I love being able to ride the train to new adventures.</p>
<h4><b>citi bike.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/citi-bike.jpg" alt="Citi Bike" />
<p>Once I got a <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citi Bike</a> subscription the possibilities to explore grew even more. The bike allows us to go places that trains don't as conveniently (I.e, across Central Park) and with distances greater than I feel like walking in the New York City summer heat. At only $163/year for unlimited 45-minute rides, I can't NOT participate.</p>
<h4><b>clinique cheek pop in berry pop.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/clinique-pop.jpg" alt="Clinique Pop" />
<p>I've been experimenting with different parts of my makeup routine that I didn't used to do and now there are some I can't feel complete without. One of them is <b>blush</b>. I've had this product since my initial makeup-loving/self-empowerment phase began a few years ago and would use it sometimes but wasn't comfortable with it. Now that I've had more experience with different formulations I realize why it gets such good reviews. I love how buildable it is and lasts all day. Not to mention a gorgeous color!</p>
<h4><b>central park in the summer.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/central-park-summer.jpg" alt="Central Park Summer" />
<p>This place will forever have a special spot in my heart. I call it our back yard for good reason - it's a half an avenue away from our door. We've had access to it since the day we moved and it’s been a beautiful escape from our otherwise urban environment. The views, the bike rides, the fresh air, the free music, the free performances. I wanted to capture this moment because it represents our beginning here.</p>
<p>All in all, August was an amazing month. I started my career and this blog, I started a new life in a brand new place, and I'm continuing to find my ever-evolving sense of self. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me!</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of any makeup routine is eyeshadow. I don’t consider myself creative or artistic, but with eyeshadows I feel that I’m able to completely transform my look and feel more confident. Whether it’s a simple look while still half-asleep in the morning or ultra glam for a night out, I have a lot of fun doing it. <b>Remember: makeup should first and foremost be applied for you, not anyone else.</b></p>
<p>Here are my essential, everyday eyeshadows. These are the ones that I travel with and reach for with almost every look. These are basically my default shadows when I’m on autopilot. For reference, I’m a Filipina and have medium brown skin with neutral undertones (Mac NW44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast, Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan). I have very dark brown eyes and my eyelids get oily so I prime and set with a base every time.</p>

Here's a compilation of my Sunday self-care routine. </p> <a href="/articles/5-ways-to-sunday-self-care-that-doesnt-break-the-bank">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/sunday-self-care.jpg" alt="Sunday Self Care" />
<p>Sundays are really important for me to feel I can tackle the week ahead. When I was a resident, the Sundays I wasn’t working were the days I felt I had control of my life. As transient as that feeling was once Monday hit, I still saw Sundays as a chance to start fresh. With the limited time to re-group, I developed the essential habits I continue to do now. Some of these may seem a bit *basic*, but I’ve learned that a compilation of what seem like little things become significant for self-care. You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for a massage and spa to reap the benefits (although, more power to you if can!). </p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Tidy the house.</b> It really is true that a tidy space helps develop a healthy mind. Don’t get me wrong, I am NOT a neat freak. I leave my clothes on the floor and don’t wash dishes immediately and never make my bed. But when clutter comes at the cost of not knowing where your essential things are and you create obstacle courses in your room, it can deter from the focus of your self-care routine. You can control the cleanliness of your environment, so take advantage of it and tidy up. I make it a Sunday morning ritual after breakfast and it sets a great stage for the rest of the day.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b> Meal prep.</b> Monday mornings are tough. Tuesday mornings are tough. Let’s face it, if you’re not a morning person then most of them are tough. I do as much as I can on Sunday’s to minimize the thinking I have to do each the morning. Sundays are usually one of my grocery days and it gives me a fighting chance to actually bring my lunch to work. In addition to preparing lunch, I also take the opportunity to cook a nice Sunday night meal. It’s a good mindfulness activity for me.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Weekly goals.</b> By the late afternoon I’m ready to check my work email and calendar. It’s important to be able to see the week’s landscape on Sunday while your mind has rested than on Monday morning when you’re expected to be “on” from the moment you step into the office. See what fires may be brewing for the week and what tasks must get done. By preparing on Sunday you’re able to be less reactionary to what is happening around you and take control of whatever situations arise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Nail care.</b> This is an example of one #treatyoself I like to do on Sundays when I have the time to paint my nails and not do anything for a while as they dry. Nail care is something that helps me to feel polished and confident. Treat yourself to what you enjoy to feel pampered and polished.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Skin care.</b> This is another example of my self-pamper regimen. I like to mask either with clay or a sheet depending on what I think my skin needs are. Putting on a mask is a mindfulness activity for me while doubling as skin care. It also helps me not look so tired on Monday morning (but coffee does this, too!). If you’re looking for a great, affordable, heavy duty clay mask, try out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014P8L9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014P8L9W&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=2cfe5b6a34a4eb1d543e9a60860fe801">Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay</a>. My boyfriend and I will do these masks together and our faces feel so soft and clean afterwards!</p>
<p>These are a few examples of little things you can do to feel empowered to kick ass and take names at work this week. The important thing is to find what works for you and dedicate to self-care.</p>

<p>I just finished my third week on the job. One thing I’m still getting used to transitioning from resident to full-fledged pharmacist is not feeling guilty about taking time to do things other than work. As a resident, there were usually so many things to get done that you didn’t know how to take a mental break. And if you made the choice to not work, many would feel odd about it knowing that there was someone else still working.</p>
<p>But now, living in New York City there is always so much to do right outside your door. I have no choice but to disconnect from work and enjoy everything around me. Here’s a taste of microadventures of the week.</p>
<img src="/images/nycfc.jpg" alt="NYCFC" />
<p>My boyfriend and I were given some tickets to a New York City FC soccer game in Yankee Stadium. It was a lot of fun! And I got to see the Bronx for the first time.</p>
<img src="/images/salmon-don.jpg" alt="Salmon Don" />
<p>We also tried a new spot on 82nd St. and Amsterdam Ave. called <a href="http://www.jinramen.com/uws_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > Jin Ramen</a>. I didn’t get ramen, I got the Sake Ikura Don (marinated salmon sashimi, salmon roe, daikon, kaiware, shiso leaf, shredded egg, nori, and zuke sauce). It was delicious! But I’m biasedRead More I love raw salmon.</p>
<img src="/images/eclipse.jpg" alt="Eclipse" />
<p>We weren’t in the “path of totality” here in New York, but we got to see a part of the eclipse! I was able to borrow someone’s eclipse glasses at work to see it. Seeing the totality videos were truly amazing.</p>
<img src="/images/evening-walk.jpg" alt="Evening Walk" />
<p>After happy hour one night this week, the weather was perfect for a walk in Central Park. Made for a great photo, don’t you think?</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/next-generation.jpg" alt="Next Generation" />
<p>My boyfriend and I went to a <a href="https://www.nycfc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New York City FC </a>
 soccer match in Yankee Stadium, and on the subway back home we had chatted with a small group of kids ranging from 4 to 10 years old (my guess). They started chatting with us asking if we went to a soccer game based on the crowd and our attire. We talked about the game and they asked how much it was. When we said some seats were only $10-15 they looked at each other in excitement and one said, “We can save up our money and go to one of those!” They were so curious about sports, who we were, what we were doing there.</p>
<p>With every response it seemed they realized we weren’t distant adults with no possible things in common, but rather were giving them glimpses of hope that they could be doing things just like us. Riding the train with these kids even just for a few minutes I felt happiness in their curiosity and hopeful in their untainted attitudes toward what was around them.</p>
<p>We reached the stop where we would transfer trains, which was the same stop these kids were getting off to go home. Our next train was already at the station and we eagerly pushed our way through the crowd to try to make it. When we made it across to the next train, we saw the oldest kid there keeping the door open for us! “I got you,” he said. He had our backs, and it was SO awesome.</p>
<p>The first thing my boyfriend said when we sat on our next train home was, “Those kids need to go to a soccer game.”</p>
<p>It was such a refreshing interaction to speak to these kids. In the whirlwind of politics, career, and trying to get our own sh*t together, we can forget that we have to foster the next generation, too. We have to make our surroundings better than how we found it (or made it) so that kids like the ones we met never lose hope in their own possibilities.</p>

<p>YouTube was founded in 2005 when I was a sophomore in high school(!). I still remember the yearbook that featured YouTube as one of the highlights of the year. My use of YouTube has evolved from primarily watching music videos to now being a source of anything I could think of. The first time I recall the concept of checking YouTube to learn how to do something was when my mom figured out how to fix some plumbing issues in our house while my dad was out of town. What a concept! But it wasn't until a couple of years ago I started using YouTube as my go-to for my visual/auditory learning needs. Below is a list of random things I've used YouTube to learn from.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>How to tie buttons back on your clothes.</b> I had a pile of clothes that I refused to throw out because of a popped button, but at the same time kept putting off actually learning how to do it. One day I thought, if I use YouTube for other things, why not this? It totally worked.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Excel functions.</b> I used these videos out of necessity during residency for my research and rotation projects. What I love about these are that they're usually voiceover style so I can use Excel and follow along the videos to know where to click/type at the same time.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>How to install a window AC unit.</b> This was a lifesaver when moving to New York City and cooled us down after a full day of driving and moving up 3 flights of stairs for a few hours. Instead of paying our apartment maintenance guy, I watched a video of how to do it and my boyfriend installed them. Turns out it's pretty easy!</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>New York apartment interior design.</b> When preparing to move to New York City, I was addicted to watching apartment tours to see how people stored and organized their things in a small space. This was a great way for me to get an idea of what could (and could not be) possible. I'll admit, I did some YouTube window shopping for penthousesRead More anything's possible, right?</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Piano.</b> This tip come from my boyfriend who taught himself some tunes via YouTube! I love listening to him play different songs especially knowing it was self-taught.</p>
<p>I hope these give you some ideas of YouTube lessons. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/college-self.jpg" alt="College Self" />
<p>This August is the first one in my life that I will not be having a "first day of school". It's crazy to think, but also refreshing to be able to focus on developing my career on the job. I've had first days with a lot of different academic environments. In high school I was a big fish in a small pond. In college I was culture-shocked as a tiny tadpole in one of the Great Lakes. In pharmacy school it was ~150 people in the same lecture room all day long. And then getting my MS, it was a whirlwind balancing evening coursework with a full residency program. Each environment had its own challenges that built from the previous experience, but I believe the hardest transition of all was the one from high school to college. It almost feels like an extension of your teenage years where you think you're invincible but at the same time feel pressured to be a completely functional #adult. What does that mean, anyway?</p>
<p>Below are 10 things I would tell my college self!</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Embrace not having things figured out.</b> College is a difficult time. You're trying to reconcile the structure you had in high school with the open freedom of living on your own for the first time. Throw in the highlight reels of social media and fantasy of TV shows/movies, and you have a perfect storm to create a ton of insecurity and identity crises. Now that I'm in my late 20's and just really getting going, I think back to my 18-22 year old time frame and think, "Man, I wish I had spent less time worry about finding my path and trying new things instead." You don't know what you don't know. Take advantage of it now so that when you have a lot more responsibility you will have the wisdom and perspective to ground you in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Fail.</b> This is something that may seem like a ridiculous tip if you're used to achieving everything you work towards. But by never failing, you don't develop the coping strategies to overcome the stumbles. In college, you have a lot of buffer around you that allows you to experiment and fail while still seeing the light of day. Reflect on what went wrong and what opportunities you could learn to improve. Have your support structure (mentors, family, friends) there for you as a sounding board (and shoulder to cry on). Know that you'll fail time and time again throughout the rest of your life. If you embrace it as a positive now and you will be able to develop building blocks of resilience in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Save money.</b> I'm hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with no savings account. When I think back of all that I splurged on and money I spent to eat out just because I was lazy, I realize how much I could have automated to my savings account and never touched. I could have been in a much more financially stable place now if I had basic financial advising right out of high school (if not earlier).</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Go to class.</b> I can't emphasize this enough. It's so easy to skip once you go to college and your parents aren't keeping you accountable. I don't care if you pay attention (although you should), but get yourself out of bed and into the classroom. Not only will it help you start making good habits, but you'll do so much better in that class just by being there and listening for key examination points. Go with a friend! Help each other with class attendance.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Take advantage of study hours.</b> In addition to going to class, if your class has homework assignments then go to study hours if you need help. Study hours are usually conducted by Teaching Assistants who have taken the class before, have an ear with the professor, helps write exams, grades exams, etc. Also, if you're like me and went to a large university with lecture halls filled with hundreds of students, study hours are a great way to get individualized attention to ask your questions in front of a smaller audience.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Stay in your dorms for at least a year.</b> I left the dorms after a few months because I was uncomfortable. I spent a lot of time off campus at other apartments because my friends were older. By doing this I missed out on organized social events on campus, meeting new people in the dorms, and learning to persevere through the discomfort. My recommendation: lean in to everything your campus has to offer in your first year. Apartments will always be there later.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Change your major.</b> The identity college students feel with their major is strong. It's essentially the equivalent to your name, since introductions always go to "What's your major?". The stamp of "Undecided" can feel like a dunce cap surrounded by people who seem like they have their lives figured out. The truth of the matter is, the major you have now may not land you the job you envision because you may change your interests, the workforce will change, and life will change. If you don't like what you're doing now after giving it a fair shot, take advantage of your resources and explore something new.</p>
<p className="tabbed">8. <b>Try a new hobby.</b> Campuses are full of clubs for anything you can think of. And if it doesn't exist, feel empowered to create it! Joining clubs and exploring hobbies are a great way to create balance in your life, have fun, and in some cases pursue leadership positions within the ranks.</p>
<p className="tabbed">9. <b>Learn to share spaces.</b> With the first taste of freedom of living on your own, it's easy to let go of the rest of your self-care. Make your bed, keep your room clean, wash your dishes, and maintain your regular hygiene. Odds are you share a space (dorm, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc.). It's important now to develop productive habits and make sure your cone of freedom doesn't interfere with anyone else's.</p>
<p className="tabbed">10. <b>Don't isolate your family.</b> If you're lucky, you made it to college with the support of your family in one way or another. In this phase of your life you begin to learn that your parents are human beings who went through similar struggles with their sense of self. Take advantage of their wisdom. If they don't treat you like an independent adult yet, give them time to also learn to let go. And never deny the gift packages from home. Your roommates/dorm-mates will appreciate it, too!</p>

<p>I fully admit one of my guilty pleasures is binge-watching YouTube "beauty influencers". Whatever your skin type is and daily routine, it takes trial and error to find out what works for you. The Q&A below is for reference for you to know it doesn't always have to be a 10-step foundation routine to look flawless. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of fun putting on makeup and when I know I have an evening event, I will plan to spend a lot of time on it. But for every day and getting ready for a long work day, what matters is what makes you feel comfortable and confident to take on your challenges.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin type?</b></p>
<p>I have oily skin, lucky me! I have occasional breakouts that leave pigmented scars. If you have oily skin too, I'm happy to share my tricks to controlling shine throughout the day. Hint - it starts with skin care.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin color and undertone?</b></p>
<p>I'm a Filipina and my skin color is brown with neutral undertones. For color reference, I use MAC NW 44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast (370), and Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan (320).</p>
<p><b>What tools do you use?</b></p>
<p>I've gone through a few different brushes, by my default brush to to blend out my foundation is the Morphe M439. I love how dense and short the bristles are and having the curved top as opposed to a flat top is more comfortable on the face. When I'm not too lazy to soak a Beauty Blender, I will use that too. But when I'm half awake in the morning on autopilot I pick up the brush.</p>
<p><b>How do you prep your face for foundation?</b></p>
<p>The very first thing I do when I wake up and before any makeup application is to wash it. I only do soap and water. I put on some lotion and wait 10 minutes, then I'm ready to go. This is usually when I start my coffee for the morning. As far as primer, I don't actually use those as much but I'm investigating some oil-control ones - stay tuned!</p>
<p><b>What do you use to set your face?</b></p>
<p>I keep it simple with powder to set the foundation. I find this to be essential if you have oily skin. Pictured is Estee Lauder Double Matte Oil-Control Pressed Powder in Medium/Deep (04). As you can see it's hitting pan and I plan to replace it with Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder next!</p>
<p><b>What are products you don't use every day?</b></p>
<p>When I'm getting ready for work in the morning, I keep it simple but effective. I don't use concealer under the eyes, instead I do a second layer of foundation. I don't use any sort of setting spray. And I don't contour/bronze. I am interested in pursuing this someday but for now, I only use blush and highlight.</p>

<p>One thing I learned quickly when moving to New York City was that brunch is a big deal. Every restaurant open has a brunch special of some sort. My boyfriend and I came up with our criteria for picking a place to actually stop and sit. Below are 4 considerations we have, along with some tips for the optimal experience in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Bottomless drink option vs. lower glass per glass.</b> Of course, drinks are the best part of brunch. There are options for a mimosa, blood Mary and bellini in many locations. Looking through different places there were some with $5 per drink options, and other discounted prices. But if you're not in a rush and you feel you'll drink more than 2 glasses, go for the bottomless option. With these morning cocktails ranging from $11-15, you can reap the benefits of the bottomless drink price after 2-3 drinks. Deciding between choices requires a little bit of calculation but worth the cost-savings in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Unlimited time for bottomless drinks.</b> If you find a spot with bottomless drinks, check the fine print. Some places will have a time limit to keep a table. This makes total sense from a business perspective, but as a consumer if you want to be somewhere for a few hours to optimize your cost per drink ratio, unlimited time options exist!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>See if you can eat at the bar.</b> In case you can't find a place that has unlimited time for your bottomless drinks, eat at the bar. This eliminates depending on your waiter/waitress for refills.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Research the menu.</b> This one is obvious. You'll want to eat with all of the bottomless drinks. Make sure the menu looks good!</p>
<p>Where's my favorite brunch place so far? In my neighborhood on the Upper West Side, that would be <a href="http://www.ellakitchenbar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ella Kitchen & Bar</a>. This place hit all of the criteria. Bottomless drink option between mimosa, bloody mary, bellini, and cava for $17 with no time limit that we could see on the menu (we stayed ~1.5 hours). We ate at the bar and our bartender didn't let our glasses empty. We were able to switch between types of drinks - not sure if this was a bartender perk, but it didn't state against it on the menu. And the food. was. delicious.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-cream-eggs.jpg" alt="Cream Eggs"/>
<p><b>Smoked Salmon Baked Eggs.</b>Three eggs, multigrain toast & home fries. Eggs are cooked with heavy cream & parmesan cheese. Smoked salmon with chives, dill & cream cheese. This was so sinfully good with the cream and cheeses. It came out on a cast iron platter, allowing the parmesan cheese to continue cooking into a delicious crust. The cream cheese was splattered in dollops and served as a scrumptious surprise since they were camouflaged with the cream and egg whites. I would order this every single time.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-wellington.jpg" alt="The Wellington"/>
<p><b>Wellington Eggs Benedict.</b>Poached eggs on house-baked English muffin, roasted chile hollandaise & home fries. Grass-fed skirt steak & sauteed spinach. My boyfriend got this meal, and let's just say there was no leftover. Can you blame him?</p>
<p>Where are your favorite brunch spots, and how do you pick them?</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/orienting-yourself.jpg" alt="First Day!"/>
<p>I started my first training-wheels-off job last Monday and most things are different from where I trained. The culture, the people, the protocols, etc. As a resident, I was one of the Chief Residents for Orientation where I helped coordinate on-boarding 35 Pharmacy Residents. With my specialty training I also coordinated on-boarding of new Managers while on rotations, and had lectures on the importance of getting a good start as part of my Masters degree.</p>
<p>An effective orientation is like getting a good first impression. It can say a lot about an institution's overall organization and how engaged your hiring manager is. A quality orientation experience can improve employee retention and engagement in the long run. This means less employee turnover and apathy, better team morale, and cost savings (training is expensive!).</p>
<p>With all of the didactic training and coordination of orientation schedules/experiences for others, it's time to create the effective experience for myself.  One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it!</p>
<p>Below are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months.</p>
<p>1. <b>Keep an open mind.</b> You don't know what you don't know. Seek to understand. All of these phrases basically mean, shut up and listen. Don't kid yourself thinking that you know, well, anything. It's a great place to be for now - embrace it.</p>
<p>2. <b>What got you here won't get you there.</b> Similar to the previous one, don't think that the knowledge you had that got you hired is what is going to make you the most successful. Keep your cards to yourself until you understand the organization first. Blow their minds with your abilities after you've earned their trust.</p>
<p>3. <b>Focus on building relationships.</b> You are not a one person show. If you are onboarding to a new organization, large or small, everyone has a place. And relationships are key. Get a feel for who you can go to for certain needs, who could be a mentor, and who can collaborate with in the future.</p>
<p>4. <b>Get lost.</b> Try to find places on your own (but don't be afraid to ask for directions so you're not late!). By walking places on your own instead of having someone escort you, you'll get lost less in the long run. And you may even find some secret spots to have lunch in solitude.</p>
<p>5. <b>Bring paper and pen.</b> It still sets a good first impression than taking notes on a mobile device. I always start with writing things down in my moleskin notebook until I see examples of otherwise.</p>
<p>6. <b>Under promise and over deliver.</b> Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. All of my mentors have advised not to join too many committees, promise too many deliverables to start, etc. Be a productive and effective team member and understand the culture/politics around you. When the time is right, flex your muscles.</p>
<p>7. <b>Trust the process.</b> Remember that while all organizations have room for improvement, you do not have the historical context behind decisions that give you the bandwidth to make any change recommendations just yet. Trust the process, keep notes of what went well and what didn't, and when the time is right discuss these opportunities with your hiring manager.</p>
<p>8. <b>Communicate.</b> Over communicate with your hiring manager. The more you communicate now, the more trust you will build with your boss. Communicate when you are unsure. You will likely have different people orienting you throughout the process and people will over- or under-assume you know anything. Tell your trainers upfront where you are in the process, and don't let them assume you know something you don't. On the other hand, don't let your trainers speak too long about things you already know because that wastes everyone's time. Speak up for yourself - this is your time and sets the platform for the rest of your time at the institution.</p>
<p>9. <b>Build good habits from day 1.</b> This is your opportunity to set your environment within appropriate bounds. Your email is empty so you can start your organization system from scratch. You can create your boundaries for working after hours/weekends now (unless your boss has different expectations). If you build good habits now, it will help in the long run for resilience in the workplace and happiness at home.</p>
<p>10. <b>Start with the basics.</b> Learn where the bathroom is, how to clock in, make sure you get paid.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to see if these tips worked for me in the long run. I hope some of these will work for you.</p>

<img src="/images/graduation-end.jpg" alt="graduation:" />
<p>I was raised in a family and culture where education meant success. If you did well in school, the rest of your life would fall into place. Well, I've gotten a lot of higher education throughout the past couple of decades with three degrees to my name (BS, PharmD, MS). And while I've held jobs as I progressed through my coursework, and staffed as part of my residency program, the graduation days have finally ended and the training wheels are off. At 28 years old, I officially have entered the next step of my career.</p> 
<p>What's funny about it is that I feel like I'm learning the same #adulting struggles now as those just finishing their undergraduate degrees. Except now I'm in much more debt and haven't been able to hold a saving's account because of school. Coming out of it and transitioning to the workforce, I wonder if it was worth it. At times I feel really behind after all of those long days, sleep lost, and money left on the table. I'm in my late 20's and just learning about 401k's, taxable income, and health insurance (despite being a healthcare professional). But at least I know how to cook?</p> 
<p>The truth is, without all of the experiences I had before today I wouldn't be exploring New York City with someone I love, with the potential for amazing new experiences ahead of us. Yes, I've spent a lot of my life studying and struggling, but I learned so much along the way. I learned a lot about life, what I want from it, and how to get it. I've gained independence and perspective that had I rushed out into the real world a decade earlier I may not have in the same way.</p> 
<p>What I've learned is that when the graduation days end, life is just beginning. There is still so much more to learn and I choose to see it as a fun challenge. If you're in a similar boat where you are coming into the workforce feeling behind, I encourage you to take on the challenge with a positive perspective. Take value in where you came from, the mistakes you made, and accomplishments you earned. Use them to take on the unknown future and make it what you want.</p>

<p>Welcome to Coffee Meets Polished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day, to when we have to go out into the world as our more polished selves.</p>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader.</p>
<p>I studied Biology at the University of Florida and moved to North Carolina for pharmacy school at UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. While in pharmacy school I led a Communications and Social Media Management team for a national pharmacy organization where I discovered a new skill set and creative avenue to engage audiences. We focused on sharing stories of other student pharmacists to create a national platform idea promotion and collegiality.</p>
<p>Once I became a licensed pharmacist, I stayed in Chapel Hill two more years for residency where I specialized in Health-System Pharmacy Administration (yes, that's a specialty). Residency was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
<p>Now I'm in New York City pursuing the next step in my professional career in a brand new environment but finally without the training wheels on. Luckily I get to have my love by my side, too. You'll get to meet him throughout the journey!</p>
<b>Ok, but why did you start this blog?</b>
<p>I created this blog to share my story in hopes that if others can relate, they realize they're not alone. I feel most myself when I wake up on a Saturday morning and drink coffee while catching up on my YouTube subscriptions. But I also feel myself in wedges and a blazer managing projects and taking care of patients. One cannot exist without the other. This blog represents my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration (not balance) of my personal and professional lives.</p>
<b>But, what do I get out of it?</b>
<p>It’s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you to create the necessary boundaries between home and work to maintain resilience and happiness. At a minimum, my goal is that you leave this page feeling happy with you who are. If I'm lucky, you'll feel empowered to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
