I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath", image: "images/sunrise.jpg", category: "Morning Thoughts"},

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Welcome to CoffeeMeetsPolished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day on the couch, to when we have to go out into the world pressured to be more polished.</p>
          <p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader. In June 2017, I completed a residency program that was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
          <p>I created this blog in my late-20's to share my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration of personal and professional life. Itâ€™s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you. Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
